      <description>Linux provides a printf command through which we can format what we want to output.
New line 1  printf &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;     Prints a new line   Double quote 1  printf &amp;#39;\&amp;#34;\n&amp;#39; # Follow by a new line, so we can see the double quote clearly.     Prints a double quote   Backslash 1  printf &amp;#39;\\\n&amp;#39; # Follow by a new line, so we can see the backslash clearly.</description>

      <description>Bash&amp;rsquo;s startup configuration file can help us preload some other script files as well as preset general and necessary variables.
Bash provides two types of startup files, one that is loaded on login and the other that is loaded on non-login.
Login Shell Startup Files The startup files that will be loaded at login are:
Global 1  cat /etc/profile # Global startup file, Debian(Ubuntu) and Redhat(CentOS) distributions     Prints a partial content of the /etc/profile on CentOS 7 distribution     Prints a partial content of the /etc/profile on Ubuntu 18 distribution   User Specific 1  cat ~/.</description>

      <guid>https://dongchen.co/post/server-side-programming/linux/simple-but-profound/31.-bash-shell-expansions-command-arithmetic-process-substitution/</guid>
      <description>Command We can execute the output as a command by using the $() or `` symbols.
Let&amp;rsquo;s use the $() symbols to do this first:
1 2 3  echo &amp;#34;ls -l&amp;#34; &amp;gt; ls_l_command_file cat ls_l_command_file $(cat ls_l_command_file) # This will run the file content &amp;#34;ls -l&amp;#34; as a command.     Alternatively, we can use backtick symbols to achieve the same effect:
1  `cat ls_l_command_file` # This will run the file content &amp;#34;ls -l&amp;#34; as a command.</description>

      <description>Brace Expansion We can use curly braces to output something similar to the screen:
1  echo a{d,c,b}e # an official example     Prints three similar words   Another example:
1  echo M{ike,ichelle,ichael}     Prints three persons&amp;#39; names   Tilde Expansion We can get our home directory through the tilde symbol:
1  echo ~     Prints current user&amp;#39;s home directory   We can also use the tilde symbol to see what files are in our home directory:</description>

      <guid>https://dongchen.co/post/server-side-programming/linux/simple-but-profound/29.-bash-shell-variables-operations/</guid>
      <description>I believe that people who have learned how to program know what variables are, and at first it can be understood as an alias that points to the data stored in memory.
Although Bash shell and Bourne shell come with many system variables, we could also customize variables ourselves.
Check System Variables We can view existing system variables in the following ways:
Show System Variables with set We can pass the output of the set command to the less or more command to see all the variables from the beginning of the output result:</description>

      <description>With a directory stack, we can push the directories we visit sequentially into the directory stack, and when we&amp;rsquo;ve done a series of operations, we can go all the way back to the origin based on the record of the directory stack.
Directory Stack Commands The directory stack provides us with three available commands.
dirs Displays all directories recorded in the directory stack:
1  help dirs     Check dirs&amp;#39;s definition and usage   pushd Records the specified directory to the directory stack and switches the working directory to the recorded directory:</description>

      <description>CentOS does not install autocompletion support for all tools by default, so we need to install it manually.
Check If We Have Bash Completion Installed We can use the following command to verify:
1  yum list installed | grep completion   We won&amp;rsquo;t see any output if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been installed, so we need to install this package:
Install 1  yum install bash-completion -y   Although it is installed, it has not yet been loaded into the running bash, so we need to use the source command to load them into the bash:</description>

      <description>Sometimes a frequently used Linux command can be very long, and when that happens, we need the alias command to help simplify the work of human input.
We can create aliases in two common ways, one for temporary aliases and the other for permanent aliases.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at its help documentation:
1  help alias     Check alias&amp;#39;s definition and usage   We can use the alias command to view the shortcuts owned by current user:</description>

      <description>Linux servers exist to process data efficiently, and files store data, so file management is critical. Directories manage files, so directory management is more crucial.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the first one.
Print Current Working Directory Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the manual for the pwd command:
1  man pwd # pwd&amp;#39;s manual     Check pwd&amp;#39;s definition and usage   With this command, we know which directory we are currently working on:</description>

      <description>Bash Help Command Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what bash is, and you can see it through whatis bash, apropos bash or man -k bash commands:
  bash is GNU&amp;#39;s Bourne-Again SHell   The builtins is actually a soft link to bash-builtins:
  builtins is a soft link to bash-builtins   So we can use man builtins, info builtins, man bash-builtins or info bash-builtins commands to view bash&amp;rsquo;s built-in commands:</description>

      <description>With the power of the man page command, we can see what parameters a command accepts and how to use each parameter corresponding to the command. In this way, we are more efficient when using commands.
Page Sections Given the wide variety of commands, man solves the problem of command classification through section numbering.
1. User Commands Section (1) is used to categorise user commands.
Such as the date command we used earlier:</description>

      <description>In a Linux system, we can view the time of the system or the time of the underlying hardware.
Hardware Time We can view the time of the hardware by using the hwclock or clock command. We looked at the two commands separately through the ll command, and we learned that clock was a soft link to hwclock, so they were the same.
With the help of the man command, we know that hwclock is the command used by system administrators:</description>

      <description>In the early days, the operating system could only be installed directly on hardware. As the technology matures, we can implement this in a variety of ways. It can now be installed on virtual machines, in local or cloud containers, or even through the App Store.
Install linux from a local container Docker is a very mature container technology, we can easily access the Linux image of each release by installing docker container technology on Windows and Mac.</description>

      <description>History Because at that time Linus after studying Minix source code discovered that Minix&amp;rsquo;s design is terrible. So he wrote a kernel from scratch, the Linux kernel, based on the assembly and c language he had accumulated as a child. It was later used by many kernel enthusiasts and vendors to develop release versions suitable for their preferences and needs.
C language is a high-level language, its efficiency is much faster than most of the current high-level languages, but the effectiveness of c language is 30% slower than assembly language.</description>

      <description>A unit of measurement that is often misleading I often see people confuse the time and space units of Nginx, which is especially prevalent among beginners. One measure unit that most often misleads them is an m letter, which can be expressed either as megabytes or as minutes.
Space Measurement Units Bytes 1  1024 # A unit without a suffix letter stands for bytes.   Kilobytes 1  8k # A unit with a suffix letter &amp;#39;k&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;K&amp;#39; stands for kilobytes.</description>

      <description>Have a glance of Nginx default configuration file The first place we need to visit after the installation should be the nginx.conf file. This file contains everything we need for rendering a very basic static HTML web page on HTTP port 80.
Locate it through the main process If you have started your Nginx process after the installation then we can get its configuration file through the master process:
1  ps -ef | grep nginx   The result should look like:</description>

      <description>Parameters and Signals Like any other servers, Nginx has its operational instructions (parameters and signals).
The existence of these instructions makes it very convenient for us to manipulate the various configurations of Nginx. We can manipulate Nginx’s status, running path, test configuration files, etc. We can also reload Nginx’s configuration file at its runtime; this feature is handy for minor changes to Nginx while it&amp;rsquo;s running.
1. Parameters Parameters can be used to manipulate Nginx to accomplish some basic tasks.</description>

      <description>Ways to install Nginx on CentOS 7 Before we begin our journey, we must prepare a CentOS 7 Linux Server, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, you can consider getting one from Linode for very cheap price. Or you can follow along with your existing CentOS 7 Linux Server if you have one. If you are ready, then let’s begin our High-Performance Journey!
There are two ways of installation:
1. Nginx package installation This option is suggested to the newcomers since they don&amp;rsquo;t know much details about what exactly Nginx use for, so the first thing they need to do is to quickly install it and start playing around with it.</description>

      <description>Many companies start on a shoestring budget at first, so they choose Cheap Hosting Plans. However, as they are growing bigger and bigger, their customers are also growing. The next most significant consideration is their portals’ PERFORMANCE.
Most Hosting Plans use Apache Server, it suits well for little traffic websites, but it is a nightmare for high traffic websites, that’s why Nginx was born. People then start moving their websites to Dedicated Virtual Servers.</description>
