      <description>My Experience I started working in the industry in early 2014 until 2019, five years ago, but I stumbled upon a pattern. A trendy technology that is fast in popularity, and which will be eliminated very quickly. So I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to catch up with fashion technology for no reason, but before you catch up, do you think it&amp;rsquo;s going to be out of date?</description>

      <title>A little about me</title>

      <description>My Story I went to a small island country with my family in 2000 to work in the retail business, and then in 2009, I came to New Zealand to study, and after graduation, I spent a few months in a fish shop and then a few months at a construction site. In 2014, a fortuitous opportunity brought me to a New Zealand telecoms company and opened the way for me to grow in technology.</description>

      <description>A unit of measurement that is often misleading I often see people confuse the time and space units of Nginx, which is especially prevalent among beginners. One measure unit that most often misleads them is an m letter, which can be expressed either as megabytes or as minutes.
Space Measurement Units Bytes 1  1024 # A unit without a suffix letter stands for bytes.   Kilobytes 1  8k # A unit with a suffix letter &amp;#39;k&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;K&amp;#39; stands for kilobytes.</description>

      <title>How did I pass the Zend PHP7 Certified Engineer exam</title>

      <description>The other day I received an email from a fellow, which he sent me through Zend&amp;rsquo;s list of certifiers. Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other until then, I felt that since we were all in the community of PHP, I should help him sort out the areas he needed to pay attention to before taking the exam. However, it would be nice if other people who had to prepare for the ZCE PHP7 also found this article.</description>

      <description>Have a glance of Nginx default configuration file The first place we need to visit after the installation should be the nginx.conf file. This file contains everything we need for rendering a very basic static HTML web page on HTTP port 80.
Locate it through the main process If you have started your Nginx process after the installation then we can get its configuration file through the master process:
1  ps -ef | grep nginx   The result should look like:</description>

      <title>3. Basic Nginx operations</title>

      <description>Parameters and Signals Like any other servers, Nginx has its operational instructions (parameters and signals).
The existence of these instructions makes it very convenient for us to manipulate the various configurations of Nginx. We can manipulate Nginx’s status, running path, test configuration files, etc. We can also reload Nginx’s configuration file at its runtime; this feature is handy for minor changes to Nginx while it&amp;rsquo;s running.
1. Parameters Parameters can be used to manipulate Nginx to accomplish some basic tasks.</description>

      <description>Ways to install Nginx on CentOS 7 Before we begin our journey, we must prepare a CentOS 7 Linux Server, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, you can consider getting one from Linode for very cheap price. Or you can follow along with your existing CentOS 7 Linux Server if you have one. If you are ready, then let’s begin our High-Performance Journey!
There are two ways of installation:
1. Nginx package installation This option is suggested to the newcomers since they don&amp;rsquo;t know much details about what exactly Nginx use for, so the first thing they need to do is to quickly install it and start playing around with it.</description>

      <description>Many companies start on a shoestring budget at first, so they choose Cheap Hosting Plans. However, as they are growing bigger and bigger, their customers are also growing. The next most significant consideration is their portals’ PERFORMANCE.
Most Hosting Plans use Apache Server, it suits well for little traffic websites, but it is a nightmare for high traffic websites, that’s why Nginx was born. People then start moving their websites to Dedicated Virtual Servers.</description>
