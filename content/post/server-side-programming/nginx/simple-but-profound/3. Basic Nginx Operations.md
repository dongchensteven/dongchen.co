Like any other servers, Nginx definitely has its own operational instructions (known as a signal). We can manipulate Nginx’s status by using these instructions. We can also reload Nginx’s configuration file at its runtime, this feature is handy for minor configuration updates while Nginx is running.

The ‌Fast Shutdown signal: (terminates all Nginx related processes immediately, especially the master and worker processes)

```bash
nginx -s stop
```

The ‌Graceful Shutdown signal: (waiting for worker processes to finish serving current requests)

```bash
nginx -s quit
```

The ‌Reopen Log Files signal: (this command will let Nginx tries to reopen a log file, it will create one if the log file doesn't exist. Without this instruction, Nginx will continue writing the original log file, even if we rename it by using mv command)

```bash
nginx -s reopen
```

The Reload Configuration File signal: (Nginx provides this beneficial instruction to reload its modified configuration file during its runtime)

```bash
nginx -s reload
```
