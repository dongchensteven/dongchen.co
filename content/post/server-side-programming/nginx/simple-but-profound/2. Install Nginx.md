Before we begin our journey, we must prepare at least a Basic Linux Server. Or you can follow along with your existing up to date Linux Server if you have one. If you are ready, then let’s begin our High-Performance Journey!

Let’s install Nginx first:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo
```

Paste in the following content:

```ini
[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/7/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

‌Update the local repo:

```bash
sudo yum update
```

Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo yum install nginx -y
```

After the installation, we start Nginx immediately, and we should enable Nginx at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Make sure Nginx has started both master and worker processes:

```bash
ps -ef | grep nginx
```

The results of running the command should be similar to the screenshot listed below:

Make sure Nginx is listening on port 80:

```bash
sudo netstat -anp | grep nginx
```

The results of running the command should be similar to the screenshot listed below:

{{% figure src="../images/2_nginx_listening_on_port_80.png" title="Nginx Master & Worker Processes" alt="img" %}}

Finally, let’s also make sure we can visit Nginx’s default home page:

```bash
curl http://localhost
```

Result should look like:
