# Ways to install Nginx on CentOS 7

Before we begin our journey, we must prepare a CentOS 7 Linux Server, if you don't have one, you can consider getting one from [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=6dbaf596fccc4d80aa991a21e94127870ad098ab) for very cheap price. Or you can follow along with your existing CentOS 7  Linux Server if you have one. If you are ready, then let’s begin our High-Performance Journey!

There are two ways of installation:

## 1. Nginx package installation

This option is suggested to the newcomers since they don't know much details about what exactly Nginx use for, so the first thing they need to do is to quickly install it and start playing around with it.

### Add Nginx repo into yum.repos.d directory

Create nginx.repo under yum.repos.d directory

```bash
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo
```

Paste in the following content:

```ini
[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/7/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

### Update the local yum repository

‌Update the local repo:

```bash
sudo yum update
```

### Installation begins

Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo yum install nginx -y
```

### Start Nginx and enable it at boot

After the installation, we start Nginx immediately, and we should enable Nginx at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### Check if it is working properly

Make sure Nginx has started both master and worker processes:

```bash
ps -ef | grep nginx
```

The results of running the command should be similar to the screenshot listed below:

### Check if it is listening on port 80

Make sure Nginx is listening on port 80:

```bash
sudo netstat -anp | grep nginx
```

The results of running the command should be similar to the screenshot listed below:

### Check to see if it is actually working

Finally, let’s also make sure we can visit Nginx’s default home page:

```bash
curl http://localhost
```

Result should look like:

## 2. Nginx source code installation

Source code installation is recommended for more complex situations, for example: customizing prefix directory, include necessary modules and exclude unnecessary modules.

### Download source code

Download the source code to tmp directory:

```bash
yum install wget -y    # Install wget
cd /tmp    # Go to tmp directory.
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.14.2.tar.gz    # Download .tar.gz file to current directory.
tar -xzf nginx-1.14.2.tar.gz    # Unpack the compressed file.
```

### Configure a path to install

```bash
cd nginx-1.14.2
./configure --prefix=/etc/nginx    # install binary files to /etc/nginx directory
```

### Compile to executable files

```bash
yum install gcc -y
make    # make compilation based on the built configuration.
```

### Copy executable files to the configured prefix directory

```bash
make install    # This copies all the built executable files to the prefix directory.
```
