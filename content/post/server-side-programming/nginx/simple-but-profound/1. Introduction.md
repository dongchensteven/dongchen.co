Many companies start on a shoestring budget at first, so they choose [Cheap Hosting Plans](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1988370&m=41388&b=394686). However, as they are growing bigger and bigger, their customers are also growing. The next most significant consideration is their portals’ **PERFORMANCE**.

Most Hosting Plans use Apache Server, it suits well for little traffic websites, but it is a nightmare for high traffic websites, that’s why Nginx was born. People then start moving their websites to [Dedicated Virtual Servers](https://www.linode.com/?r=6dbaf596fccc4d80aa991a21e94127870ad098ab).

We can customise our tools and apps on a Dedicated Virtual Server. We can even deploy a highly customizable High-Performance Nginx Server on it, and it can split the filtered traffics to one or more correspondent static or dynamic servers(For example PHP-FPM) that serve the final static resources or business logic services.
