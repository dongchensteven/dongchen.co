We can switch between users through the su and sudo commands. Also, we can use these two commands to perform certain command operations with the privileges of other users.

<!--more-->

# su

Here are two arguments for mesg command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| - or -l or &#8209;&#8209;login | Start a shell as a login shell and switch to the specified user's home directory. |

## Stay on the Current Working Directory After Switching User

By default, the su command replaces the current user with the root user.

```bash
whoami
pwd
su    # This is equivalent to su root
pwd
whoami
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/whoami_pwd_su_whoami_pwd.png" title="Stay on current working directory after replacing the user" alt="img" %}}

When we replace root with user, we don't need to enter a password.

## Change Current Working Directory to the Switched User Home Directory

With the - or -l or -login option, we can use the new current user's home directory as the working directory after replacing the user:

```bash
whoami
pwd
su -    # This is equivalent to su -l or su --login
pwd
whoami
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/whoami_pwd_su_-_whoami_pwd.png" title="Change to root's current working directory after replacing the user" alt="img" %}}

# sudo

## Edit Sudoers File

### Locked Before Editing

A more rigorous approach, which locks the /etc/sudoers file and then opens it:

```bash
visudo    # After marking as occupied, open the /etc/sudoers file through the vi editor
```

At this point, if a user logged in via another terminal also wants to edit the / etc/sudoers file via visudo, the following alert will appear:

{{% figure src="../images/49/visudo_again.png" title="When a user is editing the / etc/sudoers file through the visudo command, there is no way for other users to use the visudo command at this point." alt="img" %}}

### Naked Editing

One less rigorous approach is to open the /etc/sudoers file directly and others can edit it at the same time:

```bash
vi /etc/sudoers
```

### Editing the Content

```bash
# 1. Safely open the /etc/sudoers file through visudo command
visudo
```

```ini
# 2. Paste this line of setting in that file
usropt ALL=(root) PASSWD:/usr/sbin/userdel,/usr/sbin/usermod, NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/useradd
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/etc_sudoers_usropt.png" title="The line that starts with usropt is our newly added configuration to the sudoers file" alt="img" %}}

```bash
# 3. Let's create a user with the same name as the configuration
useradd usropt
echo "opt123" | passwd --stdin usropt    # Set password to opt123
```

## Run the Command as Another User

Let's replace the current user with the newly created user:

```bash
su - usropt
useradd
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/su_usropt_useradd.png" title="We can't run the administrator's command directly" alt="img" %}}

We need to use the sudo command to run the administrator's command:

```bash
sudo useradd
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/sudo_useradd.png" title="With the sudo command, we ran the administrator's command" alt="img" %}}

When configured, if the command is assigned under passwd, you need to enter the user's password when using the command to prevent malicious abuse of account permissions by others:

```bash
sudo userdel    # Needs to provide the current user's password
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/sudo_userdel.png" title="After entering the password of the usropt user, the command can be executed" alt="img" %}}

## Alias

We can subdivide each as a part through alias:

```bash
su -    # Replace the current user with root
visudo    # Open the /etc/sudoers file again
```

```ini
# Replace the previous setting with below settings
User_Alias USROPT = usropt
Host_Alias USROPTHOST = ALL
Runas_Alias USROPTRUNAS = root
Cmd_Alias USROPTCMDNOPIN = /usr/sbin/useradd
Cmd_Alias USROPTCMDPIN = /usr/sbin/usermod,/usr/sbin/userdel,!/usr/bin/passwd root,/usr/bin/passwd [A-Za-z]*
USROPT USROPTHOST=(USRRUNAS) PASSWD:USROPTCMDPIN,NOPASSWD:USROPTCMDNOPIN
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/etc_sudoers_usropt_alias.png" title="Replace the newer settings with the older one" alt="img" %}}

## wheel group

We can configure a user's privileges the same as root through the wheel group:

```bash
su -    # Replace the current user with root
visudo    # Open the /etc/sudoers file again
```

```ini
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

{{% figure src="../images/49/etc_sudoers_wheel_group.png" title="The default setting that comes with the sudoers file" alt="img" %}}

Create a new user to append a wheel supplementary group to that user:

```bash
useradd wheelopt
echo "opt123" | passwd --stdin wheelopt    # Set password to opt123
usermod -a -G wheel wheelopt    # Append wheel to user's supplementary group
su - wheelopt
id
sudo useradd    # Needs to provide the current user's password
```
