There are many things we can do with some combination of find and other commands. We can use some commands on the files we find.

<!--more-->

Let's prepare some files and directories for demonstration:

```bash
echo "Some demo content" > find_usage01
echo "Some demo content" > find_usage02
echo "More demo content" > find_usage03
echo "Some demo content to be deleted" > find_to_be_deleted01
echo "Some demo content to be deleted" > find_to_be_deleted02
echo "More demo content to be deleted" > find_to_be_deleted03
mkdir find_dir01 find_dir02 find_dir03
ll | grep 'find*'
cat find_usage01 find_usage02 find_usage03
```

{{% figure src="../images/40/echo_texts_to_multiple_files_ll_files_cat_files.png" title="Create some demo files and print out the contents" alt="img" %}}

# Run Command on One File or More Files

We can apply a command on top of a single file or multiple files that match.

## Print the Content of Each Matching File

We can apply a command to each matching file individually with the execdir option combined with the {} symbol:

{{% figure src="../images/40/find_name_files_execdir_cat_each.png" title="Run the cat command on each file individually" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Contents of All Matching Files

We can move the {} symbol to the end and ends with a + symbol to apply the command to all matching files at the same time:

{{% figure src="../images/40/find_name_files_execdir_cat_multiple.png" title="Run the cat command on all files at the same time" alt="img" %}}

# Remove Matching Files

By adding the -delete option, we can delete the matching files:

```bash
find -name '*to_be_deleted*' -delete
ll | grep 'find*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/40/find_name_files_delete_ll_files.png" title="Outputs the files whose name begins with find after removing the matching files" alt="img" %}}

# Change Permissions of the Matching Files

We can specify the type of file to which the chmod command applies through the -type option of the find command.

## Change Permissions of the Matching Regular Files

Let's enable user group's write permission on the matching files:

```bash
ll | grep 'find*'
find -type f -name 'find*' -execdir chmod g+w {} +
ll | grep 'find*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/40/ll_find_find_files_execdir_chmod_g_w_multiple_files_ll_find.png" title="Outputs all the files whose name begins with find before and after changing the group permission of the matching files" alt="img" %}}

## Change Permissions of the Matching Directories

Let's enable user group's write permission on the matching directories:

```bash
ll | grep 'find*'
find -type d -name 'find*' -execdir chmod g+w {} +
ll | grep 'find*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/40/ll_find_find_files_execdir_chmod_g_w_multiple_directories_ll_find.png" title="Outputs all the files whose name begins with find before and after changing the group permission of the matching directories" alt="img" %}}
