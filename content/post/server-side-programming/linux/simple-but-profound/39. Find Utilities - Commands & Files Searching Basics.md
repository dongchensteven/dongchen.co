Linux provides us with tools that make it easy for us to find the location of files and commands quickly and efficiently.

<!--more-->

# Find Commands

## whereis

We can use the whereis command to get the location of a command's binary, source, and user manual.

Here are some options provided by the whereis command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -s | Only search for source files. |
| -b | Only search for binary files. |
| -m | Only search for manual files. |

By default, all three options are used:

```bash
whereis ls    # This is equivalent to whereis -sbm ls
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/whereis_ls.png" title="Outputs the sources, binaries and manuals of the ls command" alt="img" %}}

## locate

We can also use the locate command to find the location of a command.

Here are some options provided by the locate command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -b or &#8209;&#8209;basename | Search by the filename. |
| -w or &#8209;&#8209;wholename | Search by the path + filename. |
| -i or &#8209;&#8209;ignore-case | The path or filename can be lowercase or uppercase. |

By default, the option -w is used:

```bash
locate '/bin/ls'    # This is equivalent to locate -w '/bin/ls'
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/locate_bin_ls.png" title="Outputs the filename that starts with ls under the /bin directory" alt="img" %}}

# Find Files

With the find command, we can find almost all the files we want.

Let's prepare some directories:

```bash
touch file01 file02 file03
mkdir -p dir01/dir01_01/dir01_01_01
mkdir -p dir01/dir01_02/dir01_02_01
mkdir -p dir01/dir01_03/dir01_03_01
mkdir -p dir02/dir02_01/dir02_01_01
mkdir -p dir02/dir02_02/dir02_02_01
mkdir -p dir02/dir02_03/dir02_03_01
ll
tree dir01 dir02
```

Here are some options provided by the find command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -name | Search by the filename. |
| -path | Search by the pathname. |
| -type d | Search for directories. |
| -type f | Search for regular files. |
| -type l | Search for symbolic(soft) links. |

## Find By Name

Iterate over all files or directories in a subdirectory whose names start with dir:

```bash
find -name 'dir*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/find_name_dir.png" title="Finds all the directories or files whose names starts with dir" alt="img" %}}

Let's look for files or directories that begin with dir01:

```bash
find -name 'dir01*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/find_name_dir01.png" title="Finds all the directories or files whose names starts with dir" alt="img" %}}

## Find By Path

If we want to find the directory we want more effectively, we can use the path option.

Let's look for directories that are structured like this: 01_02/dir

```bash
find -path '*01_02/dir*'
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/find_path_01_02_dir.png" title="Finds all the directories or files whose names starts with dir" alt="img" %}}

## Search for Directories

We can find directory type files with the -type l parameter:

```bash
find -type d
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/find_type_directory.png" title="Finds all the directories" alt="img" %}}

## Search for Regular Files

We can find regular file type files with the -type l parameter:

```bash
find -type f
```

{{% figure src="../images/39/find_type_file.png" title="Finds all the regular files" alt="img" %}}

## Search for Symbolic(Soft) Links

We can find regular file type files with the -type l parameter:

```bash
ln -s file01 file01_link    # This will create a symbolic link called file01_link
ll file01_link
find -type l
```
