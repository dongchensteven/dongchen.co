We can view the process through the pgrep command, and we can signal the process through the pkill command.

# View or Signal Processes By Name or Other Attributes

Here are some common options for both pgrep and pkill commands:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -c or &#8209;&#8209;count| Output the number of processes found instead of the normal output. |
| -f or &#8209;&#8209;full | The pattern matches all columns. |
| -g or &#8209;&#8209;pgroup pgrp,... | Output the process corresponding to the group ID. |
| -G or &#8209;&#8209;group gid,... | Output the process corresponding to the real group ID. |
| -i or &#8209;&#8209;ignore-case | Case-insensitive matching. |
| -n or &#8209;&#8209;newest | Matches only the newly started processes. |
| -o or &#8209;&#8209;oldest | Matches only the earliest started processes. |
| -P or &#8209;&#8209;parent ppid,... | Matches only those processes whose parent processes IDs are the same as the specified IDs. |
| -s or &#8209;&#8209;session sid,... | Matches only processes with the same session IDs as the specified IDs. |
| -t or &#8209;&#8209;terminal term,... | Matches only processes that have the same control terminal as the specified terminal. |
| -u or &#8209;&#8209;euid euid,... | Matches only processes that have the same valid user IDs as the specified valid user IDs. |
| -U or &#8209;&#8209;uid uid,... | Matches only processes that have the same real user IDs as the specified real user IDs. |
| &#8209;&#8209;inverse | Inverts the matching condition. |
| -x or &#8209;&#8209;exact | Matches only processes with the same name as the specified pattern, if -f option is specified that means matches the command line.  |
| -F or &#8209;&#8209;pidfile file | Output the process IDs in the file, which is more useful for the pkill command. |
| -L or &#8209;&#8209;logpidfile | If the process IDs file is not locked, it will fail. |
| -r or &#8209;&#8209;runstates D,R,S,Z,... | Matches processes that are in the same state as the specified process state. |
| &#8209;&#8209;ns pid | Matches the processes at the same namespaces. |
| &#8209;&#8209;nslist name,... | Matches the processes that are at the specified namespaces, available ones are: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user, uts. |

Here are some common options for pgrep command:

| Option | Description |

| -d or &#8209;&#8209;delimiter delimiter | A string used to separate the process number of the output. |
| -l or &#8209;&#8209;list-name | List both process name and process id. |
| -a or &#8209;&#8209;list-full |  |
| -v | Inverts the matching condition. |
| -w or &#8209;&#8209;lightweight | Output thread number instead of process number. |

Here are some common options for pkill command:
