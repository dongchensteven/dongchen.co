Linux provides users with tools to communicate with each other. Some can send messages to a specified user; some can send a group of messages; some can even send content as an email to a user's inbox list.

# Send Message to a Specific User

Before we send information to a user, we first need to know which terminal the message receiver is at:

```bash
who
```

When we know the terminal of the message receiver, we can send some messages to the terminal:

```bash
write user pts/1    # Run this command first
Hi Mate,
This is a msg from root.
Root
# Press Ctrl + D at this line
```

{{% figure src="../images/48/write.png" title="Sending message to a user called user" alt="img" %}}

When the message is sent, the receiving terminal should print out the content just sent out by the root terminal:

{{% figure src="../images/48/write_received.png" title="Sending message to a user called user" alt="img" %}}

# Disable or Enable Messaging Function

We can use the mesg command to turn on or off the ability to send and receive messages.

Here are two arguments for mesg command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| n | Disable send and receive functions. This parameter is not valid for messages sent from root. |
| y | Enable send and receive functions. |

We can set root to not receive or send messages:

```bash
mesg n
```

{{% figure src="../images/48/mesg_n.png" title="Disable the send and receive functions" alt="img" %}}

When a user attempts to send a message to root, the system displays that root has disabled the messaging feature:

```bash
write root pts/0
```

{{% figure src="../images/48/write_disabled.png" title="The user attempts to send a message to a root user who has turned off the messaging function" alt="img" %}}

# Group Messaging Function

We can use the wall command to broadcast messages to all users:

```bash
wall
```

{{% figure src="../images/48/wall.png" title="Send information to all users, including the sender of the message" alt="img" %}}

When the message is broadcasted, the receiving terminals should print out the content just sent out by the root terminal:

{{% figure src="../images/48/wall_received.png" title="Broadcasting message to all users" alt="img" %}}

## Output the Message Without the Banner

With the -h option, the message sent does not display the sending host:

```bash
wall -n
```

{{% figure src="../images/48/wall_n.png" title="Send information to all users without the banner, including the sender of the message" alt="img" %}}

When the message is broadcasted, the receiving terminals should print out the content just sent out by the root terminal without the banner:

{{% figure src="../images/48/wall_n_received.png" title="Broadcasting message to all users without the banner" alt="img" %}}
