Through the last line mode of vim, we can easily execute some commands, such as switching between files, saving files, moving the cursor, deleting and replacing text and so on.

# Switching Between Opened Files

Here are some file switching commands in last line mode:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| :prev | Switch to the previous file. |
| :next | Switch to the next file. |
| :first | Switch to the first file. |
| :last | Switch to the last file. |
| :qa | Quit all opened files. |

Let's open the previously created two files at the same time:

```bash
vim vim_file vim_file2
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/vim_files.png" title="Open two files at the same time" alt="img" %}}

## Switch to the Next File

With the :prev command, we can switch to the next file's window:

```bash
:next
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/next.png" title="Switch to the next file" alt="img" %}}

After executing the next command:

{{% figure src="../images/54/next_after.png" title="After switching to the next file" alt="img" %}}

## Quit All Opened Files

```bash
:qa
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/qa.png" title="Quit all opened files" alt="img" %}}

# Save and Quit

Here are some quit and save commands in last line mode:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| :q | Quit only. |
| :q! | Forced quit. |
| :w | Save only. |
| :w! | Forced save. |
| :wq | Save and quit, this is equivalent to :x. |

## Quit Opened File

We can use the :q command to exit the file directly:

```bash
:q
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/quit.png" title="Quit file without saving the change" alt="img" %}}

# Moving Cursor to Line N

We can move the cursor to the N line by :N command:

```bash
:6    # This will move cursor to line 6
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/move_to_line_6.png" title="Move cursor to line 6" alt="img" %}}

# Delete Lines

Here are some delete commands in last line mode:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| :. | Delete current line. |
| :$ | Delete last line. |
| :+N | Delete next N lines. |
| :$-N | Delete last N lines. |
| :N | Delete line N. |
| :N1,N2d | Delete from line N1 to line N2. |

Let's delete the seventh row and move the cursor to the deleted row:

```bash
:7d    # This will remove the seventh line and move the cursor to deleted line
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/delete_line.png" title="Delete the seventh line and move the cursor over" alt="img" %}}

# Replacement

Here are two options at the end of the command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| g | Replace all matching content,ot just the first matched content of each row. |
| i | Ignore case-sensitivity. |

Let's replace dolor with dooooloooor:

```bash
:1,3s/dolor/dooooloooor/gi    # This replaces all the matched content from line one to line three
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/replacement.png" title="Replace dolor with dooooloooor from line one to line three" alt="img" %}}

# Show Line Numbers

Here are some line number related commands:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| :set number | Show line numbers, this is equivalent to :set nu |
| :setnonu | Hide line numbers. |

Let's show the line numbers:

```bash
:set number
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/set_number.png" title="Show line numbers" alt="img" %}}

# Searching Case Sensitivity

Here are some case sensitivity related commands:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| :set ignorecase | Case sensitive when searching for content, this is equivalent to :set ic |
| :set noic | Case insensitive when searching for content. |

Let's turn off case sensitivity:

```bash
/ma    # Search for ma first
:set ignorecase
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/set_ignorecase.png" title="Searching both upper and lower case content" alt="img" %}}

# Turn On or Off the Highlight Search

Here are some highlighting related commands:

| Option | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|

Let's turn off the highlight:

```bash
:set nohlsearch
```

{{% figure src="../images/54/set_nohlsearch.png" title="Won't highlight the matched content" alt="img" %}}
