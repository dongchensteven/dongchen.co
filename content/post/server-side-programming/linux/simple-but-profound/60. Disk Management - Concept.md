| GFS2 | (Global File System) from Red Hat. Available for Linux under GPL. Symmetric (GDLM) or Asymmetric (GULM). |
| OCFS2 | (Oracle Cluster File System) from Oracle Corporation. Available for Linux under GPL. Symmetric. |

## Distributed File System

| Name | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| NFS | Originally from Sun Microsystems is the standard in UNIX-based networks. NFS may use Kerberos authentication and a client cache. |

### Distributed Parallel Fault-tolerant File Systems

| Name | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Ceph | A massively scalable object store. |
| GlusterFS | A general purpose distributed file system for scalable storage. |
| MoosFS | A fault tolerant, highly available and high performance scale-out network distributed file system. |

## Special-purpose File System

### Pseudo and Virtual File Systems

| Name | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| proc | A pseudo-file system, used to access kernel information about processes. |
| tmpfs | In-memory temporary file system (on Linux platforms) |
| specfs | Special File System for device files. |
| sysfs | A virtual file system in Unix-like operating systems holding information about buses, devices, firmware, filesystems, etc. |

# Disk and Partition Suffixes

## Disks

Disks' names usually start with sd followed by a, b, c, d, etc.

| Name | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| sda | First disk. |
| sdb | Second disk. |
| sdc | Third disk. |
| sdd | Fourth disk. |
| sdN | Nth disk. |

## Partitions

Disks' partitions usually start with sd{a|b|c|d} followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

| Name | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| sda1 | First disk's first partition. |
| sda2 | First disk's second partition. |
| sda3 | First disk's third partition. |
| sda4 | First disk's fourth partition. |
| sdaN | First disk's Nth partition. |

# Format Types

## Master Boot Record (MBR)

* Used by the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) boot mode when booting the operating system.
* Almost every PCs and Servers support BIOS.
* Poor compatibility with other hardwares.
* Supports Legacy programs.
* Slower than UEFI.

Total MBR size is 512 bytes.

| Description | Size (Bytes) | Purpose |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Bootstrap code area | 446 | Run BootLoader and other necessary programs. |
| Primary partition tables | 64 = 16 Bytes * 4 | Create partition entries. |
| Boot signature | 2 | Check whether MBR is valid. |

## Global Unique Identifiers Partition Table (GPT)

* Used by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot mode when booting the operating system.
* Later PCs and Servers support UEFI.
* Good compatibility with other hardwares.
* Doesn't support Legacy programs.
* Faster than BIOS.

# Disk Modes

## Cylinder Head Sector (CHS)

1000000 GB = 1 PB

| Maximum Addressing Space (GB) | Addressing (bits) | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------|
| 8 | 24 | A legacy hard disk mode. |

## Logical Block Addressing (LBA)

1 PB = 1000000 GB

| Maximum Addressing Space (PB) | Addressing (bits) | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------|
| 128 | 48 | A later hard disk mode. |

# Device Type

## Block

Show block devices:

```bash
ll /dev | grep '^b'
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_dev_grep_b.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

## Character

Show character devices:

```bash
ll /dev | grep '^c'
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_dev_grep_c.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# Device Numbers

## Major Number

The fifth column of the device list:

```bash
ll /dev | grep '^c' | awk '{print $10, $5}'
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_dev_grep_c_awk_5.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

## Minor Number

The sixth column of the device list:

```bash
ll /dev | grep '^c' | awk '{print $10, $6}'
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_dev_grep_c_awk_6.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# Links

Create hard link:

```bash
ll
ln awk_file awk_file_ln
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_ln_file_link_ll.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

Show files and linked numbers:

```bash
ll | awk '{print $9, $2}'
```

{{% figure src="../images/60/ll_awk_2.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

## Hard Link

* Will accumulate the linked number.
* Can't be applied to directory.
* Can't be created in different partitions.
* The size of the link is the size of the original file.

## Symbolic Link

* Won't accumulate the linked number.
* Can be applied to directory.
* Can be created in different partitions.
* The size of the link is the length of the target path.
