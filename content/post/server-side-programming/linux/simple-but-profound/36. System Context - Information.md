Linux provides commands that allow you to view system-related information, and with these commands, you can quickly get some necessary system information.

<!--more-->

# Machine Hardware Name

We can get the name of the machine's hardware by the arch command:

```bash
arch    # This is equivalent to uname -m
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/arch_uname_m.png" title="Outputs machine's hardware name" alt="img" %}}

# System Information

We can use the uname command plus some of the parameters it provides to get the system-related information:

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname.png" title="Outputs the kernel's name by default" alt="img" %}}

## All Information

```bash
uname -a    # This is equivalent to uname --all
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_a.png" title="Outputs all the system information" alt="img" %}}

## Hardware Platform

```bash
uname -i    # This is equivalent to uname --hardware-platform
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_i.png" title="Outputs the system's hardware platform" alt="img" %}}

## Hardware Name

```bash
uname -m    # This is equivalent to uname --machine
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_m.png" title="Outputs the system's machine hardware name" alt="img" %}}

## Network Node Hostname

```bash
uname -n    # This is equivalent to uname --nodename
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_n.png" title="Outputs the system's network node hostname" alt="img" %}}

## Processor Type

```bash
uname -p    # This is equivalent to uname --processor
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_p.png" title="Outputs the system's processor type" alt="img" %}}

## Operating System

```bash
uname -o    # This is equivalent to uname --operating-system
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_o.png" title="Outputs the operating system's name" alt="img" %}}

## Kernel Release

```bash
uname -r    # This is equivalent to uname --kernel-release
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_r.png" title="Outputs the kernel's release" alt="img" %}}

## Kernel Name

```bash
uname -s    # This is equivalent to uname --kernel-name
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_s.png" title="Outputs the kernel's name" alt="img" %}}

## Kernel Version

```bash
uname -v    # This is equivalent to uname --kernel-version
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uname_v.png" title="Outputs the kernel's version" alt="img" %}}

# Available Processors

We can view the number of logical cpu cores available through the nproc command.

## Current Process

```bash
nproc
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/nproc.png" title="Outputs the number of available processors" alt="img" %}}

## Installed Processors

```bash
nproc --all
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/nproc_all.png" title="Outputs the number of installed processors" alt="img" %}}

# System Name

We can get the name of the current host through the hostname command:

```bash
hostname
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/hostname.png" title="Outputs the system's name" alt="img" %}}

# Numeric Host Identifier

We can get the identifier of the current host through the hostid command:

```bash
hostid
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/hostid.png" title="Outputs the system's host identifier" alt="img" %}}

# System Uptime and Load

We can use the uptime command to get the system's running time, the number of users logged in, the average load, and so on:

```bash
uptime
```

{{% figure src="../images/36/uptime.png" title="Outputs the system's running time, logged-in user counts, and the average load over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes" alt="img" %}}
