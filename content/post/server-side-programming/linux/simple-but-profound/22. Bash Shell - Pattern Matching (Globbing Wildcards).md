By matching patterns, we can easily find the files we need.

# Preparation

Let's prepare some test files first before we start:

```bash
touch 1.txt 2.doc 3.html 1.c 2.c 3.c file1.txt file2.doc file3.html 1file.txt 2file.doc 3file.html
```

# Special Pattern Characters

## Match any string

We can use the * character to match any string.

### Match any file that starts with file

```bash
ll file*
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_file_any_string.png" title="Finds any file with filename begin with file" alt="img" %}}

### Match any file that ends with .txt

```bash
ll *.txt
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_any_string_txt.png" title="Finds any with filename ends with .txt" alt="img" %}}

## Match any character

We can use the ? character to match any character.

### Match any file with a 1-character filename

```bash
ll ?.*
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_one_character_any_string.png" title="Finds any file with a 1-character filename" alt="img" %}}

### Match any file with a 4-character extension

```bash
ll *.????
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_any_string_four_characters.png" title="Finds any file with a 1-character filename" alt="img" %}}

## Match any one of enclosed characters

We can use the [] range expression to match any one of enclosed characters.

### Match any file that starts with 1, 2 or f

```bash
ll [12f]*
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_one_two_f_any_string.png" title="Finds any file that starts with 1, 2 or 3" alt="img" %}}

### Match any file that starts with 1, 2 or 3

```bash
ll [1-3]*
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_one_to_three_any_string.png" title="Finds any file that starts with 1, 2 or 3" alt="img" %}}

### Match any file that starts without 1, 2 or 3

```bash
ll [^1-3]*
```

{{% figure src="../images/22/ll_without_one_to_three_any_string.png" title="Finds any file that starts without 1, 2 or 3" alt="img" %}}
