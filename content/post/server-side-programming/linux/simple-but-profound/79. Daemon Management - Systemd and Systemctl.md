Through the systemctl command, we can easily manage the systemd system and services.

# Possible Directories for Daemons

* /etc/systemd/system/*
* /run/systemd/system/*
* /usr/lib/systemd/system/*

# Service Daemon Types

Here are some types for system service:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| .service | Specify the services of the system. |
| .socket | Socket files used for inter-process communication. There must be corresponding service files. |
| .snapshot | System snapshots. |
| .device | Devices that are recognized by the kernel under the /sys or /dev directory. |
| .mount | Mount points where the file systems are mounted. |
| .automount | Automatic mount point of file system controlled by systemd. |
| .swap | Swap devices or in-memory paging files controlled by systemd. |
| .target | Target units simply combine an existing set of units and dependencies, and they do not provide additional functionality by themselves. They are more flexible than SysV runlevels in the classic SysV init system. |
| .path | Path for path-based activation controlled by systemd. |
