Let's prepare some files first:

```bash
mkdir find_dir
touch find_dir/file{1,2,3}
ln -s file1 find_dir/file1_link
dd if=/dev/zero of=find_dir/file_5MB bs=5000000 count=1
cd find_dir
ll
```

# Examples

## Files Visited in 30 Minutes

```bash
find . -amin -30
```

## Files That the Current User Can Read and Write

With the combination of -readable, -a and -writable options, we can find the files and directories that the current user can read and write:

```bash
find . -readable -a -writable
```

{{% figure src="../images/52/find_dir_readable_a_writable.png" title="Find readable and writable files and directories" alt="img" %}}

## Files That Are Writable to Its Group

With the -perm g=w option, we can find files that can be written by the group to which the file belongs:

```bash
find . -perm g=w
```

## Files That Are Equal to 5MB

With the -size option, we can find files greater than, less than or equal to the specified size:

```bash
find . -size 5M
```

{{% figure src="../images/52/find_dir_size_5m.png" title="Find files whose size are equal to 5MB" alt="img" %}}

## Execute the Command on the Found Files

With the -exec; option, we can use the command on the found file:

```bash
find . -readable -a -writable -exec ls {} \;
```

## List the Found Files With -dils Options

With the -ls action, we can list the found files in ls -dils format:

```bash
find . -readable -a -writable -ls;
```

{{% figure src="../images/52/find_dir_readable_a_writable_ls.png" title="Find readable and writable files and directories" alt="img" %}}

## Delete All the Links

Through -type -l tests followed by -delete action, we can remove all the links:
