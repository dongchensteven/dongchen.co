Linux provides us with some expansions for command, arithmetic, addition and subtraction, comparison, ternary, assignment, and process substitution operations.

<!--more-->

# Command

We can execute the output as a command by using the $() or `` symbols.

Let's use the $() symbols to do this first:

```bash
echo "ls -l" > ls_l_command_file
cat ls_l_command_file
$(cat ls_l_command_file)    # This will run the file content "ls -l" as a command.
```

Alternatively, we can use backtick symbols to achieve the same effect:

```bash
`cat ls_l_command_file`    # This will run the file content "ls -l" as a command.
```

# Arithmetic

We can use arithmetic expansion to quickly calculate numerical values.

Some of the operators we can use are:

| Operator | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| VARIABLE++ VARIABLE&#8209;&#8209; | self increasing or deceasing after the variable is obtained |
| ++VARIABLE &#8209;&#8209;VARIABLE | self increasing or deceasing before the variable is obtained |
| - + | negative or positive number |
| ! ~ | logical or bitwise negation |
| ** | exponentiation |
| * / % | multiplication, division, remainder |
| + - | addition, subtraction |
| <= >= < > | less than equals, greater than equals, less than, greater than |
| == != | equal or not equal |
| expr ? expr : expr | ternary operator |
| = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= | assign the operation result to a variable |

## Addition and Subtraction

```bash
echo $((1+1))    # 2
echo $((1-1))    # 0
```

## Comparison

```bash
echo $((1<=1))    # true
echo $((1>=1))    # true
echo $((1<1))    # false
echo $((1>1))    # false
echo $((1==1))    # true
echo $((1!=1))    # false
```

{{% figure src="../images/31/echo_comparison_results.png" title="Prints comparison results" alt="img" %}}

## Ternary Operator

Positive and negative numbers are true, only zero is false

```bash
echo $((1?20:-20))    # 20
echo $((0?20:-20))    # -20
echo $((-1?20:-20))    # 20
```

{{% figure src="../images/31/echo_ternary_operation_results.png" title="Prints true or false of the ternary operation result" alt="img" %}}

## Assignment Operator

```bash
NUM=2
echo $((NUM*=NUM))    # 4
echo $((NUM*=2))    # 8
echo $((NUM*=4))    # 32
```

{{% figure src="../images/31/create_variable_echo_assignment_operation_results.png" title="Prints assignment operation results" alt="img" %}}

# Process Substitution

We can use the <() symbols to use the result of the command output as a file:

```bash
cat <(ls)    # sequentially prints the listed files
tac <(ls)    # sequentially prints the listed files in reversed order
```
