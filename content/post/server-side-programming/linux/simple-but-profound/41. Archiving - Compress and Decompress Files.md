By compressing files and directories into a compressed file, we can easily move and back up the compressed file.

# Packaging and Compressing Files

Before we start selecting tools, we need to compare the pros and cons of each compression tool, so let's do it. We should take into account the feelings of these people. We need to get their consent before we can interview them.

Let's prepare a file:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=100MBFile bs=102400 count=1
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/dd_100mbfile_ll_file.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

## Packaging with tar

The tar command is a standard compression and decompression tool.

The suffix of the tar file is .tar

Here are some options provided by the tar command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -c or --create | Create a new archive. |
| -z or --gzip | Filter the archive through gzip. |
| -v or --verbose | Verbosely list files processed. |
| -x or --extract or --get | extract files from an archive. |
| -f or --file | Use archive file or device ARCHIVE, this option must be at the end. |

```bash
# Create a general archive, this won't lessen the size
tar -cvf 100MBFile.tar 100MBFile    # In addition to f, other options' position can be changed at will
ll 100MB*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/tar_100mbfile_ll_file.png" title="The archived file's size is greater than the origin" alt="img" %}}

### Compressing with -z option

By adding the z option, the tar command compresses the file with the gzip algorithm:

```bash
tar -czvf 100MBFile.tar.gz 100MBFile
ll 100MB*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/tar_gzip_100mbfile_ll_file.png" title="The archived file's size is way more less than the origin" alt="img" %}}

## Compressing with gzip

Since gzip will delete the original file after compression, we need to clone a new file:

```bash
# Clone 100MBFile to 100MBFileGZIP
cp 100MBFile 100MBFileGZIP
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/cp_file_newfile_gzip_ll_file.png" title="Clone a new file called 100MBFileGZIP and list the files" alt="img" %}}

```bash
# This will use the Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77) to compress the file
gzip 100MBFileGZIP
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/gzip_file_ll_file.png" title="Compress the file with gzip command" alt="img" %}}

## Compressing with bzip2

An upgraded version of gzip.

Since bzip2 will delete the original file after compression, we need to clone a new file:

```bash
# Clone 100MBFile to 100MBFileGZIP
cp 100MBFile 100MBFileBZIP2
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/cp_file_newfile_bzip2_ll_file.png" title="Clone a new file called 100MBFileBZIP2 and list the files" alt="img" %}}

```bash
# This will use the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm and Huffman coding to compress the file
bzip2 100MBFileBZIP2
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/bzip2_file_ll_file.png" title="Compress the file with bzip2 command" alt="img" %}}

## Compressing with xz

A tool with a high compression ratio.

Since xz will delete the original file after compression, we need to clone a new file:

```bash
# Clone 100MBFile to 100MBFileXZ
cp 100MBFile 100MBFileXZ
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/cp_file_newfile_xz_ll_file.png" title="Clone a new file called 100MBFileXZ and list the files" alt="img" %}}

```bash
xz 100MBFileXZ
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/xz_file_ll_file.png" title="Compress the file with xz command" alt="img" %}}

# Unpackaging and Decompressing Files

## Unpackaging with tar

```bash
tar -xf 100MBFile.tar    # tar command will keep the archived file after decompressing
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/tar_extract_100mbfile_ll_file.png" title="Unpack the file with option x" alt="img" %}}

## Decompressing with gunzip

```bash
gunzip 100MBFileGZIP.gz    # gunzip command will remove the archived file after decompressing
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/gunzip_file_ll_file.png" title="Decompress the file with gunzip command" alt="img" %}}

## Decompressing with bunzip2

```bash
bunzip2 100MBFileBZIP2.bz2    # bunzip2 command will remove the archived file after decompressing
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/bunzip2_file_ll_file.png" title="Decompress the file with bunzip2 command" alt="img" %}}

## Decompressing with unxz

```bash
unxz 100MBFileXZ.xz    # unxz command will remove the archived file after decompressing
ll 100MBFile*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/unxz_file_ll_file.png" title="Decompress the file with unxz command" alt="img" %}}

# View Packed Files and Compressed Files Contents

Let's prepare some text files that can be viewed in a compressed file:

```bash
echo 'This is a README.txt file for GZIP' > READMEGZIP
echo 'This is a README.txt file for BZIP2' > READMEBZIP2
echo 'This is a README.txt file for XZ' > READMEXZ
gzip READMEGZIP
bzip2 READMEBZIP2
xz READMEXZ
ll README*
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/echo_texts_to_files_compress_files_ll_file.png" title="Prepare three text files for the view commands provided by gzip, bzip2 and xz utility" alt="img" %}}

## Viewing Files with tar

List option for tar command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -t or --list | list the contents of an archive. |

We can view the files packed in the .tar archive with option -t:

```bash
tar -tf 100MBFile.tar    # Don't forget the f option behind it
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/tar_tf_archive.png" title="View compressed files in an .tar archive" alt="img" %}}

## Viewing Files with gzip

List option for gzip command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -l or --list | List each compressed file. |

We can view the files compressed in the .gz archive with option -l or --list:

```bash
gzip -l READMEGZIP.gz    # This is equivalent to gzip --list READMEGZIP.gz
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/gzip_l_archive.png" title="View compressed files in an .gz archive" alt="img" %}}

## Viewing Files with xz

List option for xz command:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| -l or --list | Print information about compressed files. |

We can view the files compressed in the .xz archive with option -l or --list:

```bash
xz -l READMEXZ.xz    # This is equivalent to xz --list READMEXZ.xz
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/xz_l_archive.png" title="View compressed files in an .xz archive" alt="img" %}}

## Viewing with zcat, zmore, bzless, zgrep

```bash
zcat READMEGZIP.gz
zmore READMEGZIP.gz
zgrep -e 'is a' READMEGZIP.gz
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/zcat_zmore_zgrep_archive_file.png" title="View the .gz archive file's text content with zcat, zmore and zgrep commands" alt="img" %}}

zless will be another option.

## Viewing with bzcat, bzmore, bzless, bzgrep

```bash
bzcat READMEBZIP2.bz2
bzmore READMEBZIP2.bz2
bzgrep -e 'is a' READMEBZIP2.bz2
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/bzcat_bzmore_bzgrep_archive_file.png" title="View the .bz2 archive file's text content with bzcat, bzmore and bzgrep commands" alt="img" %}}

bzless will be another option.

## Viewing with xzcat, xzmore, xzless, xzgrep

```bash
xzcat READMEXZ.xz
xzmore READMEXZ.xz
xzgrep -e 'is a' READMEXZ.xz
```

{{% figure src="../images/41/xzcat_xzmore_xzgrep_archive_file.png" title="View the .xz archive file's text content with xzcat, xzmore and xzgrep commands" alt="img" %}}

xzless will be another option.
