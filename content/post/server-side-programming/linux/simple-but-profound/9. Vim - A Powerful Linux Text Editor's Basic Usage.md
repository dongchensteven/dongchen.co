Vim Text editor can efficiently help us quickly create or modify some common text type files, such as configuration files:

{{% figure src="../images/9/man_vim.png" title="Check vim's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

# Create File

```bash
vim newfile    # After running the command, it'll create an empty file called newfile
```

{{% figure src="../images/9/vim_new.png" title="Create a new file" alt="img" %}}

# Command Mode

Vim opens a file in command mode:

{{% figure src="../images/9/vim_new_ran.png" title="Command mode" alt="img" %}}

## Help

We can view the command-related help by the: help command:

```vim
:help
```

{{% figure src="../images/9/command_mode_help.png" title="Before pressing the Enter key" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/9/command_mode_help_after.png" title="After pressing the Enter key" alt="img" %}}

To go back to command mode, just type :q and press Enter:

```vim
:q
```

# Insert Mode

We can press the letter i on the keyboard to enter to insert mode:

{{% figure src="../images/9/enter_to_insert_mode.png" title="This is shown at the left bottom of the screen" alt="img" %}}

Let's write something:

{{% figure src="../images/9/insert_mode_typing.png" title="We have wrote something in the insert mode" alt="img" %}}

We can press the ESC key to go back to command mode:

{{% figure src="../images/9/back_to_command_mode.png" title="The -- Insert -- text shown at the left bottom of the screen has gone" alt="img" %}}

# Command Mode Operations

We can do a lot of things in command mode, such as searching, undo changes, save, exit files, and other more advanced uses.

## Save

We can type the :w command in command mode and press enter to save the file:

```vim
:w
```

{{% figure src="../images/9/command_mode_save.png" title="Before pressing the Enter key" alt="img" %}}

After we save the command, we can see some basic information about the file at the bottom: of the screen

{{% figure src="../images/9/command_mode_save_after.png" title="After pressing the Enter key" alt="img" %}}

## Exit

If we have saved the written content, we can exit vim by :q command and press Enter:

```vim
:q
```

{{% figure src="../images/9/command_mode_exit.png" title="Before pressing the Enter key" alt="img" %}}

# Edit File

Opening a file is almost the same as creating a file:

{{% figure src="../images/9/vim_edit.png" title="Edit an existing file" alt="img" %}}

The difference between an existing file and a new file is the basic information at the bottom of the screen after the file is opened, the existing file has the basic information, and the new file has nothing:

{{% figure src="../images/9/vim_edit_ran.png" title="After opening an existing file" alt="img" %}}
