With a directory stack, we can push the directories we visit sequentially into the directory stack, and when we've done a series of operations, we can go all the way back to the origin based on the record of the directory stack.

# Directory Stack Commands

The directory stack provides us with three available commands.

## dirs

Displays all directories recorded in the directory stack:

```bash
help dirs
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/help_dirs.png" title="Check dirs's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

## pushd

Records the specified directory to the directory stack and switches the working directory to the recorded directory:

```bash
help pushd
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/help_pushd.png" title="Check pushd's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

## popd

Remove the last directory recorded in the directory stack and switch the working directory to the removed directory:

```bash
help popd
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/help_popd.png" title="Check popd's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

# Preparing Directories

Let's prepare some directories for demonstration:

```bash
mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e/f/g
tree a
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/mkdir_recursive_tree.png" title="Create nested directories and show their tree structure" alt="img" %}}

Now that we have some nested directories, we can begin to demonstrate. The directory stack can store any directory we push into, and the nested directory is used here just for ease of operation.

# Use of Commands

## Adding Directories

Let's adding directories to directory stack:

```bash
cd ~
dirs
pushd a
pushd b
pushd c
pushd d
pushd e
pushd f
pushd g
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/cd_dirs_pushd.png" title="Switch to user's home directory, check to make sure that dirs only shows the tilde(~) and start pushing the nested directories into directory stack" alt="img" %}}

## Show Recorded Directories

### By Default

Use *dirs* to print the recorded directories:

```bash
dirs
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs.png" title="Show the directory stack recorded directories" alt="img" %}}

### With User Home Directory Name

Use *dirs -l* to print the recorded directories with user home directory's name instead of a tilde:

```bash
dirs -l
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs_l.png" title="Show the directory stack recorded directories with user home name instead of a tilde" alt="img" %}}

### Line by Line

Use *dirs -p* to print the recorded directories line by line:

```bash
dirs -p
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs_p.png" title="Show the directory stack recorded directories line by line" alt="img" %}}

### Line by Line With Their Indexes

Use *dirs -v* to print the recorded directories line by line with their indexes:

```bash
dirs -v
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs_v.png" title="Show the directory stack recorded directories line by line with their indexes" alt="img" %}}

### First Recorded Directory

Use *dirs -0* to print the first recorded directory:

```bash
dirs -0
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs_first.png" title="Show the first recorded directory" alt="img" %}}

### Last Recorded Directory

Use *dirs +0* to print the last recorded directory:

```bash
dirs +0
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/dirs_last.png" title="Show the last recorded directory" alt="img" %}}

## Use Recorded Directories

### Use From right

Use *pushd -0* to change to the rightmost directory and use it as a working directory:

```bash
pushd -0
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/pushd_use_first.png" title="Use the first recorded directory" alt="img" %}}

### Use From left

Use *pushd +1* to change to the directory before the leftmost one and use it as a working directory:

```bash
pushd +1
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/pushd_use_previous.png" title="Use the previous recorded directory" alt="img" %}}

## Remove Recorded Directories

### Remove From right

Use *popd -0* to remove the rightmost directory:

```bash
popd -0
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/popd_remove_first.png" title="Remove the first recorded directory" alt="img" %}}

### Remove From left

Use *popd +0* to remove the leftmost directory and use the previous directory as a working directory:

```bash
popd +0
```

{{% figure src="../images/18/popd_remove_last_move_to_previous.png" title="Remove the last recorded directory and use the previous recorded directory as the working directory" alt="img" %}}
