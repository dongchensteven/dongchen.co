A tool called iostat can be used to display CPU reports, it can also be used to display disk, partition input and output statistics reports.

# CPU Utilization Report

Here are some columns of CPU report:

| Column | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| %user | User level CPU usage. (application CPU usage) |
| %nice | CPU usage with nice priority at the user level. |
| %system | System level CPU usage. (kernel CPU usage) |
| %iowait | The time CPU or CPUs were idle when the system had an unfinished disk I/O operation. |
| %steal | The amount of time the current processor unwillingly waits when the hypervisor is serving other virtual processors. |
| %idle | The time CPU or CPUs were idle when the system had no unfinished disk I/O operations. |

# Device Utilization Report

Here are some columns of device report:

| Column | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Device | The device (partition) name listed under the /dev directory. |
| tps | Transfers per second sent to the device. Each transfer is an I/O request, which is usually a combination of multiple logical requests. |
| Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s) | The number of blocks read from the device per second. |
| Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s) | The number of blocks written to the device per second. |
| Blk_dscd/s (kB_dscd/s, MB_dscd/s) | The number of blocks discarded for the device per second. |
| Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read) | The total number of blocks read from the device. |
| Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn) | The total number of blocks written to the device. |
| Blk_dscd (kB_dscd, MB_dscd) | The total number of blocks discarded for the device. |
| r/s | Read requests per second completed for the device. |
| w/s | Write requests per second completed for the device. |
| d/s | Discard requests per second completed for the device. |
| sec/s (kB/s, MB/s) | The number of sectors read from, written to, or discarded for the device per second. |
| rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s) | The number of sectors read from the device per second. |
| wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s) | The number of sectors written to the device per second. |
| dsec/s (dkB/s, dMB/s) | The number of sectors discarded for the device per second. |
| rqm/s | The number of merged I/O requests per second in the device queue. |
| rrqm/s | The number of merged read requests per second in the device queue. |
| wrqm/s | The number of merged write requests per second in the device queue. |
| drqm/s | The number of merged discarded requests per second in the device queue. |
| %rrqm | The percentage of merged read requests per second before being sent to the device. |
| %wrqm | The percentage of merged write requests per second before being sent to the device. |
| %drqm | The percentage of merged discard requests per second before being sent to the device. |
| areq-sz | The average size of the I/O requests sent to the device. |
| rareq-sz | The average size of the I/O read requests sent to the device. |
| wareq-sz | The average size of the I/O write requests sent to the device. |
| dareq-sz | The average size of the I/O discard requests sent to the device. |
| await | Average time spent on I/O requests sent to the device, including queuing and service time. |
| r_await | Average time spent on read requests sent to the device, including queuing and service time. |
| w_await | Average time spent on write requests sent to the device, including queuing and service time. |
| d_await | Average time spent on discard requests sent to the device, including queuing and service time. |
| aqu-sz | The average queue length sent to the device. |
| %util | The percentage of time run-time I/O requests sent to the device. |

# Options

Here are some sorting commands for glances:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -c | Show CPU Report |
| -d | Show Device Report |
| -g group_name {device [...]&#x7c;ALL} | Show Statistics for a Group of Devices |
| -h | Show Device Report as Human Readable Format |
| -k | Show Units in Kilobytes |
| -m | Show Units in Megabytes |
| -p [{device[,...]&#x7c;ALL}] | Show Block Devices and Their Partitions |
| -t | Show the Time for Each Report |
| -x | Show Extended Information |

# Examples

We need to install it first:

```bash
yum install sysstat -y
```

## Run iostat

```bash
iostat 1 2    # 1 is the time used to show the next output, 2 is the number of outputs.
```
