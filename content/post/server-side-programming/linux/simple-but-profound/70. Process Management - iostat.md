# CPU Utilization Report

Here are some details of CPU report:

| Header | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| %user | User level CPU usage. (application CPU usage) |
| %nice | CPU usage with nice priority at the user level. |
| %system | System level CPU usage. (kernel CPU usage) |
| %iowait | The time CPU or CPUs were idle when the system had an unfinished disk I/O operation. |
| %steal | The amount of time the current processor unwillingly waits when the hypervisor is serving other virtual processors. |
| %idle | The time CPU or CPUs were idle when the system had no unfinished disk I/O operations. |

# Options

Here are some sorting commands for glances:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -c | Show CPU Report |
| -d | Show Device Report |
| -g group_name {device [...]&#x7c;ALL} | Show Statistics for a Group of Devices |
| -h | Show Device Report as Human Readable Format |
| -k | Show Units in Kilobytes |
| -m | Show Units in Megabytes |
| -p [{device[,...]&#x7c;ALL}] | Show Block Devices and Their Partitions |
| -t | Show the Time for Each Report |

# Examples

We need to install it first:

```bash
yum install sysstat -y
```

## Run iostat

```bash
iostat 1 2    # 1 is the time used to show the next output, 2 is the number of outputs.
```
