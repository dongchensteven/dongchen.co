I believe that people who have learned how to program know what variables are, and at first it can be understood as an alias that points to the data stored in memory.

Although Bash shell and Bourne shell come with many [system variables](/post/server-side-programming/linux/simple-but-profound/13.-bourne-and-bash-shells-environment-variables/), we could also customize variables ourselves.

# Check System Variables

We can view existing system variables in the following ways:

## Show System Variables with set

We can pass the output of the set command to the less or more command to see all the variables from the beginning of the output result:

```bash
set | less    # or set | more
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/set_less.png" title="Pipes set command's result to less command" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/29/set_less_result.png" title="Use the less command to navigate to the start of the set command's output result." alt="img" %}}

We can type the q key to exit the the less command's interactive mode.

## Show Environment Variables with printenv

We can use the printenv command to output the current environment variables:

```bash
printenv
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/printenv.png" title="Prints current environment's variables" alt="img" %}}

## Show Environment Variables with env

We can also use the env command to output the current environment variable:

```bash
env
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/env.png" title="Prints current environment's variables" alt="img" %}}

The output is quite similar to printenv command's output result.

## Show Shell Variables with export

We can use the export command to output shell variables:

```bash
export    # equivalent to export -p
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/export.png" title="Prints shell variables" alt="img" %}}

## Show Value of a Variable with echo

We can use the echo command to output variable's value to the screen:

```bash
echo $PATH    # prints PATH variable's value
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/echo_path.png" title="Prints the variable that contains directories of all the executable files" alt="img" %}}

# Variable Operations

## Create a Variable for the Current Shell

We can create a variable directly by the name=value format:

```bash
MY_NAME='I am Dong'
echo $MY_NAME
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/create_variable_echo_variable.png" title="Prints the created MY_NAME variable" alt="img" %}}

We can try to access this variable in the offspring shell:

```bash
bash    # switch into a child shell
echo $MY_NAME
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/bash_echo_variable.png" title="Prints the created MY_NAME variable in a child shell" alt="img" %}}

From the screenshot, we can see that we can't use the MY_NAME variable created by the parent shell in the child shell.

## Set a Variable as Shell Variable

The variable we just created can only be accessed in the current shell, what should we do if we want to access it in our offspring shell?

We can set the created variable to the shell variable through the export command in the shell where the variable was created, so that all descendants of the shell can access the variable:

```bash
export MY_NAME
bash
echo $MY_NAME
```

## Reference a Variable in a String

We can reference the created variable in a string:

```bash
echo "$MY_NAME, how are you?"
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/echo_string_with_a_referenced_variable.png" title="Prints a string that referenced the MY_NAME variable" alt="img" %}}

## Create an Array Variable

We can create an array variable that contains multiple elements:

```bash
MY_NAME[1]="Dong"
MY_NAME[2]="Chen"
echo "My first name is ${MY_NAME[1]}, my last name is ${MY_NAME[2]}"
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/create_array_variable_echo_variable.png" title="Prints the first and second elements of the created array variable" alt="img" %}}

## Remove a Variable

We can delete a variable or an array variable through the unset command:

```bash
echo ${MY_NAME[1]} ${MY_NAME[2]}: $MY_NAME
unset MY_NAME
echo ${MY_NAME[1]} ${MY_NAME[2]}: $MY_NAME
```

{{% figure src="../images/29/echo_variable_unset_variable_echo_variable.png" title="Unset the MY_NAME variable, this will also remove the array elements stored in that variable" alt="img" %}}
