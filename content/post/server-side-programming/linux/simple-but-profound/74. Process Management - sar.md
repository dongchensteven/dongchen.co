# Statistics

## Paging

Here are descriptions for paging fields:

| Field | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| pgpgin/s | The total number of bytes that the system has paged in from the disk per second. |
| pgpgout/s | The total number of bytes that the system has paged out to the disk per second. |
| fault/s | The number of page-missing failures (major and minor faults) per second caused by the system. |
| majflt/s | The number of major faults per second caused by the system. |
| pgfree/s | The number of pages that the system stores in the idle list per second. |
| pgscank/s | The number of pages scanned per second by the kswapd daemon. |
| pgscand/s | The number of pages scanned directly per second. |
| pgsteal/s | The number of pages that the system reclaims per second from the page cache and the swap cache. |
| %vmeff | The formula for this percentage is pgsteal divided by pgscan, which represents the efficiency of page reclaim. |

# Options
