The Linux core toolset provides us with some commands to view user-related information.

<!--more-->

# Print User Identity

We can use the id command to view the user's ID, name, user's group ID and name, etc:

```bash
id
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id.png" title="By default, id output the real user ID, real group ID, effective user ID (if different from the real user ID), effective group ID(if different from the real group ID), and supplement group IDs" alt="img" %}}

## Print the User ID

If we add the -u option, the command will only output the user's ID:

```bash
id -u    # This is equivalent to id --user
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_u.png" title="Output the user's ID" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Group ID

If we add the -g option, the command will only output the group ID:

```bash
id -g    # This is equivalent to id --group
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_g.png" title="Output the user's group ID" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Group ID and the Supplementary Groups

If we add the -G option, the command will only output the supplementary groups' ID:

```bash
id -G    # This is equivalent to id --groups
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_g_uppercase.png" title="Output the user's group ID and supplementary groups" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Name, Group Name, Supplementary Group Name of the User

If we add the -un, -gn or -Gn option, the command will only output the user's name, group name, and supplementary group's name:

```bash
id -un    # This is equivalent to id -u --name
id -gn    # This is equivalent to id -g --name
id -Gn    # This is equivalent to id -G --name
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_u_g_g_uppercase_n.png" title="Output the user's name, group name and supplementary group name" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Real ID, Real Group ID, Real Supplementary Group ID of the User

If we add the -ur, -gr or -Gr option, the command will only output the user's real ID, group real ID, and supplementary group's real ID:

```bash
id -ur    # This is equivalent to id -u --real
id -gr    # This is equivalent to id -g --real
id -Gr    # This is equivalent to id -G --real
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_u_g_g_uppercase_r.png" title="Output the user's real ID, group real ID, and supplementary group's real ID" alt="img" %}}

## Print the Security Context of the User

If we add the -Z option, the command will only output the user's security context:

```bash
id -Z    # This is equivalent to id --context
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/id_z_uppercase.png" title="Output the user's security context" alt="img" %}}

# Print Current Login Name

We can use logname command to display the user name of the current login:

```bash
logname
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/logname.png" title="Output the user's login name" alt="img" %}}

# Print Who is Currently Logged in

We can use who command to display the logged in user names and other login details:

```bash
who
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/who.png" title="Output the information about users who are currently logged on" alt="img" %}}

# Print Effective User ID

We can use whoami command to display the effective user ID:

```bash
whoami    # This is equivalent to id -un
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/whoami.png" title="Output the effective user ID" alt="img" %}}

# Print Group Names the User Belongs to

We can use group command to display the user's belonging group names:

```bash
groups    # This is equivalent to id -Gn
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/groups.png" title="Output the user's beloging groups" alt="img" %}}

Or we can specify a user name to view the group to which the user belongs:

```bash
groups [username]
```

# Print Users Names

We can use users command to display the logged in users' names:

```bash
users
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/users.png" title="Output the users' name" alt="img" %}}

# Print User Details With finger

We can use finger command to display the user names currently logged in:

```bash
yum install finger -y
finger root
```

{{% figure src="../images/42/finger_user.png" title="Output the details of the specified user" alt="img" %}}
