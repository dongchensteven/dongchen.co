With commands such as bg fg jobs, we can do something about jobs in the background.

<!--more-->

# &

Keep a command running in the background of the current session:

```bash
vi &
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/vi_&.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# bg

Wake up the paused background processes in the current environment and continue running.

```bash
bg
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/bg.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# fg

Moves a background process from the current environment to the foreground.

```bash
fg
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/fg.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# jobs

Show the status of the background jobs in the current session.

Here are some options for jobs command:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -l | Show the job number, current job, process group number, status, and the command that make up the job. |
| -p | Show the process group leader IDs of the jobs. |

```bash
vi &
jobs -l
jobs -p
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/vi_jobs_l_p.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

# nohup

Prepare an infinite loop script:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
'#!/bin/bash' \
'while true; do' \
'echo "a"' > script.sh
echo 'done' >> script.sh
```

Keep the script running in the background, even if the user logs out of the system, the running state of the command will not be terminated.

```bash
# echo endless a characters to script.out file
nohup sh script.sh > script.out &
ll script.out
ll script.out
ll script.out
ll script.out
ll script.out
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/nohup_ll_script_outs.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

Check for running jobs' process IDs:

```bash
jobs -l
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/jobs_l.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

Kill the running process:

```bash
kill 9802
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/kill.png" title="" alt="img" %}}

Double check the jobs:

```bash
jobs -l
```

{{% figure src="../images/67/jobs_l_again.png" title="" alt="img" %}}
