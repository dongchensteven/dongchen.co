# Brace Expansion

We can use curly braces to output something similar to the screen:

```bash
echo a{d,c,b}e    # an official example
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/echo_brace_expansion.png" title="Prints three similar words" alt="img" %}}

Another example:

```bash
echo M{ike,ichelle,ichael}
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/echo_brace_expansion_names.png" title="Prints three persons' names" alt="img" %}}

# Tilde Expansion

We can get our home directory through the tilde symbol:

```bash
echo ~
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/echo_tilde.png" title="Prints current user's home directory" alt="img" %}}

We can also use the tilde symbol to see what files are in our home directory:

```bash
ll ~
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/ll_tilde.png" title="Prints our home directory's files" alt="img" %}}

# Parameter Expansion

This expansion has difference presentations:

```bash
${param:[operator]word}
```

```bash
${[operator]param}
```

```bash
${param[operator]word}
```

## If the param is null, use the word

The presentation of this expansion is as follows:

```bash
${param:-word}
```

Let's demonstrate:

```bash
MY_NAME_HYPHEN='Dong'
echo My name is ${MY_NAME_HYPHEN:-DONG}
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variable_echo_expansion_hyphen.png" title="Prints the value of MY_NAME_HYPHEN because it's not null" alt="img" %}}

## If the param is null, replace with word and use

The presentation of this expansion is as follows:

```bash
${param:=word}
```

If there is a variable, use the value of the variable:

```bash
MY_NAME_EQUAL='Dong'
echo My name is ${MY_NAME_EQUAL:=DONG}
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variable_echo_expansion_equal.png" title="Prints the value of MY_NAME_EQUAL because it's not null" alt="img" %}}

If there is no variable, use the word and assign the value to the variable:

```bash
echo $MY_NAME_EQUAL_NULL    # We haven't create this variable, so it's null
echo My name is ${MY_NAME_EQUAL_NULL:=DONG}    # := will assign DONG to MY_NAME_EQUAL_NULL variable because it's null
echo $MY_NAME_EQUAL_NULL    # Now it's been created
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/echo_variable_echo_expansion_equal_echo_variable.png" title="Prints DONG and assign it to MY_NAME_EQUAL_NULL variable" alt="img" %}}

## If the param is not null, use the word

The presentation of this expansion is as follows:

```bash
${param:+word}
```

If the variable exists, use the word:

```bash
MY_NAME_PLUS='Dong'
echo My name is ${MY_NAME_PLUS:+DONG}
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variable_echo_expansion_plus.png" title="Prints DONG because the MY_NAME_PLUS variable is not null" alt="img" %}}

If the variable does not exist, nothing is used:

```bash
echo MY_NAME_PLUS_NULL    # We haven't create this variable, so it's null
echo My name is ${MY_NAME_PLUS_NULL:+DONG}    # Use nothing
echo MY_NAME_PLUS_NULL    # The MY_NAME_PLUS_NULL variable is null
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/echo_variable_echo_expansion_plus_echo_variable.png" title="Prints nothing because the MY_NAME_PLUS_NULL variable is not null" alt="img" %}}

## Use a value as a variable name

The presentation of this expansion is as follows:

```bash
${!param}
```

We can use the ! symbol to use the value of the variable as the name of another variable:

```bash
MY_FIRST_NAME="Dong"
MY_NAME='MY_FIRST_NAME'
echo My name is ${!MY_NAME}
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variables_echo_exclamation.png" title="Prints the MY_FIRST_NAME variable's value with indirection feature" alt="img" %}}

## Delete the content before the first or the last appearance of a specified word and output the remaining content

The presentation of this expansion is as follows:

```bash
${param#*word}
```

We can use the # symbol to delete the content before the specified word's first or last appearance include the word itself, but this won't change the value of the variable.

Delete to the first appearance:

```bash
NAMES='Jack:Rose:Marry:John:Anna:Mike'
echo $NAMES
echo ${NAMES#*:}
echo $NAMES
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variable_echo_variable_echo_expansion_sharp_echo_variable.png" title="Retrieves the variable's value before the first appearance removal and prints it after the deletion, this does not affect the variable's value." alt="img" %}}

Delete to the last appearance:

```bash
NAMES='Jack:Rose:Marry:John:Anna:Mike'
echo $NAMES
echo ${NAMES##*:}
echo $NAMES
```

{{% figure src="../images/30/create_variable_echo_variable_echo_expansion_sharp_sharp_echo_variable.png" title="Retrieves the variable's value before the last appearance removal and prints it after the deletion, this does not affect the variable's value." alt="img" %}}
