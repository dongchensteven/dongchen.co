With the power of the man page command, we can see what parameters a command accepts and how to use each parameter corresponding to the command. In this way, we are more efficient when using commands.

# Page Sections

Given the wide variety of commands, man solves the problem of command classification through section numbering.

## 1. User Commands

Section (1) is used to categorise user commands.

Such as the *date* command we used earlier:

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_date_result.png" title="man date result" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_1.html)

## 2. System Calls

Section (2) is used to categorise system call functions in the libraries provided by the Linux kernel.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_epoll_lib.png" title="epoll_create function provided by Linux kernel" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_2.html)

## 3. Library Functions

Section (3) is used to classify C language standard library functions.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_printf_c_lib.png" title="printf function provided by standard C library" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_3.html)

## 4. Devices

Section (4) is used to categorise devices in the /dev directory for Linux systems.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_zero_device.png" title="\"zero\", a special file located in /dev directory" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_4.html)

## 5. Files

Section (5) is used to categorise the description of the Linux file format and covers the /proc file system.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_os-release_file.png" title="/etc/os-release contains the current Linux's distribution info" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_5.html)

## 6. Games

Section (6) has not been used yet, so there is no appropriate example to illustrate.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_nothing_games.png" title="haven't seen the command related to this section yet" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man6/intro.6.html)

## 7. Overviews, Conventions, and Miscellaneous

Section (7) classifies some other conventional content.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_ip_convention.png" title="Network API for C language" alt="img" %}}

[More...](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_7.html)

## 8. Superuser and System Administration Commands

Section (8) categorises commands used by superusers and administrators, and this section also contains a small number of GNU C language libraries.

{{% figure src="../images/5_man_section_lvm_superuser.png" title="Logical Volume Manager tools creates virtual block devices based on physical devices" alt="img" %}}

# SYNOPSIS Options & Arguments Syntax

## Required

Angle brackets(<>) means the option or argument in the brackets is required when using the related command.

## Optional

Square brackets([]) means the option or argument in the brackets is an option when using the related command.

## Repeatable

Ellipsis(...) means the option or argument can exist multiple times when using the related command, such as *same_option1 same_option2* and so on.

## Alternation

A pipe(|) means when using the related command, we must use one of the options or arguments listed around it, for example, *option1|option2*.

## Grouping

Curly brackets({}) means the available arguments of an option when using the related command, for example, *｛param1,param2,param3｝*.
