We can determine the permissions of a file by looking at the mode bits of that file.

# Mode Bits Structure

The mode bits structure of files and directories:

| Option | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------|
| r | Read permission. |
| w | Write permission. |
| x | Execute permission. |

## Permissions of Directory and File

Let's take a look at the default permissions for the newly created files and directories:

```bash
touch mode_bits_file
mkdir mode_bits_dir
ll | grep 'mode_bits*'
```

### Directory Permissions

As we can see from the following table, the directory is:

- readable, writable and executable to the user: the user called root;
- readable and executable to the group: everyone in the root group;
- readable and executable to others: anyone else.

| User | Group | Others |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| rwx | r-x | r-x |

Without execute permission, we can't access the directory.

Without write permission, we can't add new files or delete existing files in a directory.

### File Permissions

As we can see from the following table, the file is:

- readable and writable to the user:  the user called root;
- readable to the group: everyone in the root group;
- readable to others: anyone else.

| User | Group | Others |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| rw- | r-- | r-- |

# Symbolic Modes

We can set permissions for users, groups, others, and everyone in symbolic mode.

## Permissions Assignment

We can assign read, write, and execute permissions to the file owner, file group, others or everyone through the plus, equal sign operator, or remove the appropriate permissions from the user by the minus sign operator:

| Users | Operation | Permissions |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| ugoa | +-= | rwx |

### Users

There are four users, file's owner, file's group, others, and all:

| User | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| u | Owner of the file |
| g | Group of the file |
| o | Any other users |
| a | All users, this is equivalent to ugo |

### Operations

There are three actions, append, remove, and assign:

| Operation | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| + | Append the permission(s) to user(s) |
| - | Remove the permission(s) from user(s) |
| = | Assign the permission(s) to user(s) |

### Permissions

There are three permissions, read, write, and execute, respectively:

| Permission | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| r | Readable or Viewable permission |
| w | Writable or Editable permission |
| x | Executable or Runnable permission |

## Copying Permissions

We can append the permissions of the user after the addition symbol to the permissions of the user before the addition symbol:

| Copy To | Operation | Copy From |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| ugoa | + | ugoa |

## Changing Special Mode Bits

### Set User or Group ID Mode Bit

| Users | Operation | Copy From |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| uga | +- | s |

If a directory has the group id set up, the files created in this directory belong to the group of the directory, but setting the user id does not seem to have much effect. A child directory created in this directory inherits the group to which the parent directory belongs and also inherits the special mode bit set group id.

### Set Restricted Deletion Flag or Sticky Bit

If we don't want the files we created to be deleted by others; we can add a special mode bit the so-called sticky bit to the permissions of the directory containing those files:

| User | Operation | Flag |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| o (This is optional) | +-= | t |

A file in the flagged directory can only be deleted by the root user, the owner of the directory and the file's owner.
