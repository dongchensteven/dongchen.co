The shell that Linux used in the first place was Bourne, and then Linux released Bash, which is an enhanced version of Bourne, and most Linux systems now use Bash by default.

# Bourne Shell Variables

Home and path are the two most commonly used bourne shell variables

## HOME

Current user's home directory.

```bash
echo $HOME
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_home.png" title="prints current user's home directory" alt="img" %}}

## PATH

Paths of binary files, which are runnable programs.

```bash
echo $PATH
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_path.png" title="prints the executable files' directories" alt="img" %}}

# Bash Variables

The number of environment variables in bash is so large that only a few commonly used ones are listed here:

## BASH

Print the directory where bash is stored.

```bash
echo $BASH
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_bash.png" title="prints current bash shell's directory" alt="img" %}}

## BASH_VERSION

Prints bash's version

```bash
echo $BASH_VERSION
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_bash_version.png" title="prints current bash shell's version" alt="img" %}}

## BASHPID

Current Bash's process ID.

```bash
echo $BASHPID
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_bashpid.png" title="prints current bash shell's process ID" alt="img" %}}

## GROUPS

Current user's group IDs:

```bash
echo $GROUPS
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_groups.png" title="prints current user's group ID" alt="img" %}}

## HISTFILE

The directory of history file:

```bash
echo $HISTFILE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_histfile.png" title="prints the history file's location" alt="img" %}}

## HISTFILESIZE

The allowed lines contained in the history file:

```bash
echo $HISTFILESIZE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_histfilesize.png" title="prints the history file's allowed lines" alt="img" %}}

## HISTSIZE

The allowed lines contained in the history list:

```bash
echo $HISTSIZE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_histsize.png" title="prints the history's allowed lines" alt="img" %}}

## HOSTNAME

Current host's name:

```bash
echo $HOSTNAME
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_hostname.png" title="prints the current host name" alt="img" %}}

## HOSTTYPE

Current machine type:

```bash
echo $HOSTTYPE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_hosttype.png" title="prints the current host type" alt="img" %}}

## LINENO

The line number that the current shell or script is running:

```bash
echo $LINENO
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_lineno.png" title="prints the current shell's current line number" alt="img" %}}

## MACHTYPE

The CPU architecture, company name, and type of the system which Bash is running:

```bash
echo $MACHTYPE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_machtype.png" title="prints the current machine's type" alt="img" %}}

## OSTYPE

The operating system that Bash is running on:

```bash
echo $OSTYPE
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_ostype.png" title="prints the current operating system's type" alt="img" %}}

## PPID

The shell's parent's process ID:

```bash
echo $$    # get current shell's process ID
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_$$.png" title="prints the current shell's process ID" alt="img" %}}

Switch to a new shell:

```bash
bash
```

Check parent shell's process ID:

```bash
echo $PPID
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_ppid.png" title="prints the current shell's parent shell ID" alt="img" %}}

## RANDOM

Generate a random integer number between 0 and 32767

```bash
echo $RANDOM
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_random.png" title="prints a random number between 0 and 32767" alt="img" %}}

## SECONDS

The number of seconds since shell started:

```bash
echo $SECONDS
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_seconds.png" title="prints the seconds since shell started" alt="img" %}}

## SHELL

The full path of the shell we are using

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_shell.png" title="prints the bash shell's location" alt="img" %}}

## SHLVL

The deep level of the current shell, every time a new instance of bash is started, the variable incremented by one:

```bash
echo $SHLVL
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_shlvl.png" title="prints the current bash shell's deep level" alt="img" %}}

Switch to a new bash, this starts a new bash instance:

```bash
bash
```

Check current bash's deep level:

```bash
echo $SHLVL
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_shlvl_2.png" title="prints the current bash shell's deep level" alt="img" %}}

## UID

The user ID of the current user:

```bash
echo $UID
```

{{% figure src="../images/13/echo_uid.png" title="prints the current user's ID" alt="img" %}}
