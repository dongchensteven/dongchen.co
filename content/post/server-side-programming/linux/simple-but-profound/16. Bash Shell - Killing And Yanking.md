You can cut and paste text through the killing and yanking features provided by the bash shell.

# Killing Text Forward

We can use Ctrl K to cut the text behind the cursor:

```bash
Ctrl + K    # press Control and K keys
```

# Killing Text Backward

We can use Ctrl U to cut the text before the cursor:

```bash
Ctrl + U    # press Control and K keys
```

# Killing Word Forward

We can use Alt D to cut the word on or after the cursor:

```bash
Alt + D    # press Alternate and D keys
```

# Killing Word Backward

We can use Ctrl W or Alt Backspace to cut the word before the cursor:

```bash
Ctrl + W    # press Control and W keys
```

Or:

```bash
Alt + Backspace    # press Alternate and Backspace keys
```

# Yanking (Pull word or text back from the Kill Ring)

We can use Ctrl Y to pull the killed word or text back from the kill ring.

We use either of the kill commands to demonstrate:

```bash
Ctrl + W    # press Control and W keys
```

{{% figure src="../images/16/cursor_behind_the_previous_fourth_word.png" title="after killing" alt="img" %}}

We run the following command to pull killed word back:

```bash
Ctrl + Y    # press Control and Y keys
```
