By using the nano text editor provided by Linux, we can easily do some simple text editing operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, etc.

<!--more-->

# Nano Version

We can take a look at the version of nano:

```bash
nano -V    # This is equivalent to nano --version
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_v.png" title="Checks the version of the nano we are currently using" alt="img" %}}

# Editable Mode

We can open a text editor that is editable by running the nano command directly:

```bash
nano
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_before.png" title="Running the nano command" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_after.png" title="Nano editor opened in editable mode" alt="img" %}}

Let's fill in the editor with the following two lines:

```bash
First Line
Second Line
```

## Write Content to a File

The symbol ^ (caret) corresponds to the ctrl key on our keyboard.

We can use the combination keys (Ctrl+O) to specify the name of the file that is used to hold the content:

```bash
Ctrl+O
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_after_pressing_the_ctrl_o_keys.png" title="A prompt shows up asking what the name of the file is" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_after_saving_the_content.png" title="After pressing the enter key, nano saves the content to a text file named nano_file" alt="img" %}}

We can use the combination keys (Ctrl+X) to exit nano program.

Let's take a look at the contents of the file we just created through the nano editor:

```bash
cat nano_file
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/cat_created_file.png" title="Outputs the content of the newly created text file nano_file" alt="img" %}}

# Enable Mouse Operation

Nano also provides mouse support by adding the -m parameter:

```bash
nano -m
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_m_write_out_option_circled.png" title="Entering nano editor in mouse enabled mode, this will allow us to interact nano menus with mouse pointer" alt="img" %}}

We can try clicking on the red box area in the screenshot shown above.

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_m_on_write_out_page.png" title="Now we are on the write out page" alt="img" %}}

We can click the cancel option to exit to the editor page:

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_m_write_out_cancelled.png" title="Now we are on the main page" alt="img" %}}

We can click the exit option to exit the editor.

# Viewable Mode

We can enter the view mode with the-v parameter provided by the nano tool, in which all of our edits on the specified file are invalid.

```bash
nano -v nano_file    # This is equivalent to nano --view
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_v_file.png" title="Open nano_file in viewable mode" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_v_file_opened.png" title="Opened in viewable mode" alt="img" %}}

As shown in the screenshot below, we can't do any changes to the file inside viewable mode.

# Edit an Existing File

We can use nano to edit an existing text file:

```bash
nano nano_file
```

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_file.png" title="Opening a text file to edit" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_file_opened.png" title="Editing the opened nano_file" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_file_add_third_line.png" title="Add another line" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_file_write_out_the_third_line.png" title="Write out page" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/nano_file_write_out_the_third_line_to_file.png" title="Write out the edited content to existing nano_file" alt="img" %}}

{{% figure src="../images/37/cat_edited_file.png" title="Outputs the edited nano_file" alt="img" %}}
