With word processing commands, we can quickly get the text we want from a text output or text document.

# Preparation

We can simply output a text to a file with the echo command.

Prepare contents:

```bash
echo "First line" >> file.txt
echo "Second line" >> file.txt
echo "Third line" >> file.txt
echo "Fourth line" >> file.txt
echo "Fifth line" >> file.txt
echo "Sixth line" >> file.txt
echo "Seventh line" >> file.txt
echo "Eighth line" >> file.txt
echo "Ninth line" >> file.txt
echo "Tenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Eleventh line" >> file.txt
echo "Twelfth line" >> file.txt
echo "Thirteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Fourteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Fifteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Sixteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Seventeenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Eighteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Nineteenth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twentieth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-first line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-second line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-third line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-fourth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-fifth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-sixth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-seventh line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-eighth line" >> file.txt
echo "Twenty-ninth line" >> file.txt
echo "Thirtieth line" >> file.txt
```

# Print text file contents from beginning with cat

We can use the cat command to view the text contents of the file from beginning:

```bash
cat file.txt
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/cat_file.png" title="Prints the contents of file.txt file to the screen from beginning" alt="img" %}}

# Print text file contents from end with tac

We can use the cat command to view the text contents of the file from end:

```bash
tac file.txt
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/tac_file.png" title="Prints the contents of file.txt file to the screen from end" alt="img" %}}

# Print contents and their line numbers with nl

We can use the nl command to display the text document content and the line number for each line of content:

```bash
nl file.txt    # prints contents and their line numbers
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/nl_file.png" title="Prints the contents and their line numbers" alt="img" %}}

# Print the first lines of a text file with head

We can use the head command to output the beginning of the file contents:

```bash
head file.txt    # prints first ten lines by default
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/head_file.png" title="Prints the first ten lines of the contents" alt="img" %}}

## Print the first twenty lines with parameter n

We can append a -n parameter to specify the number of rows to display

```bash
head -n 20 file.txt    # prints first twenty lines
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/head_file_twenty_lines.png" title="Prints the first twenty lines of the contents" alt="img" %}}

# Print the last lines of a text file with tail

We can use the tail command to output the ending of the file contents:

```bash
tail file.txt    # prints last ten lines by default
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/tail_file.png" title="Prints the last ten lines of the contents" alt="img" %}}

## Print the last twenty lines with parameter n

We can append a -n parameter to specify the number of rows to display

```bash
tail -n 20 file.txt    # prints last twenty lines
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/tail_file_twenty_lines.png" title="Prints the last twenty lines of the contents" alt="img" %}}

# Print and interact text file content with more

We can use the more command to view and interact a text document's contents:

```bash
more file.txt    # rarely used nowadays, suitable for small files
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/more_file.png" title="Prints the contents of file.txt file to the screen in interactive mode" alt="img" %}}

{{% admonition info "Operations in interactive mode" %}}
Some of the operations we can perform with the keyboard keys are:
{{% admonition tip "Available Manipulations" %}}
| Operation | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| /string | Search for the string in the subsequent contents. |
| :f | Show file name and current line number. |
| B key | Beginning of the contents. |
| Space key | Next page. |
| Enter key | Next line. |
| Q key | Quit interactive mode without showing the subsequent contents. |

# Print and interact text file content with less

We can also use the less command to view and interact a text document's contents:

```bash
less file.txt    # it's an enhanced version of more, suitable for large files
```

{{% figure src="../images/23/less_file.png" title="Prints the contents of file.txt file to the screen in interactive mode" alt="img" %}}

{{% admonition info "Operations in interactive mode" %}}
Some of the operations we can perform with the keyboard keys are:
{{% admonition tip "Available Manipulations" %}}
| Operation | Meaning |

| ?string | Search for the string in the preceding contents. |
| /string | Search for the string in the subsequent contents. |
| Space key | Next page. |
| Page Down key | Next page. |
| Down key | Next line. |
| Page Up key | Previous page. |
