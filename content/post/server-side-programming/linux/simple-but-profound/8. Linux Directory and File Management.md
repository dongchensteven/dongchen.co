Linux servers exist to process data efficiently, and files store data, so file management is critical. Directories manage files, so directory management is more crucial.

Let's begin with the first one.

# Print Current Working Directory

Let's take a look at the manual for the pwd command:

```bash
man pwd    # pwd's manual
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_pwd.png" title="Check pwd's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

With this command, we know which directory we are currently working on:

```bash
pwd
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/pwd.png" title="When I logged in with root, by default, I was in the /root directory" alt="img" %}}

# List Directory Contents

Check out the manual for the ls command:

```bash
man ls
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_ls.png" title="Check ls command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

Usage of ls:

```bash
ls
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/ls.png" title="This command lists all the files and directories under the current working directory but doesn't include the hidden files or directories" alt="img" %}}

Another command that is often used is a detailed version of ls, which lists file types, permissions, owners and groups, sizes, dates:

```bash
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/ll.png" title="This command shows files' and directories' only" alt="img" %}}

*ll* is an alias of *ls* as I mentioned earlier in this page: [7. Types of Commands - Alias](/post/server-side-programming/linux/simple-but-profound/7.-types-of-commands/#alias)

If you want to display hidden files and directories, you append the -a argument to the ll command, which is one of the commands I use most often:

```bash
ll -a
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/ll_a.png" title="This command shows files' and directories' only" alt="img" %}}

The first directory (.) is parent directory, the one below (..) is current working directory. Hidden files or directories usually start with a dot. A line starts with a hyphen (-) means that it is a file if it starts with a letter (d) indicate that it is a directory.

# Make Directory

Sometimes we need to create new directories to hold files, and with the help of the *mkdir* command, we can do it:

```bash
man mkdir
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_mkdir.png" title="Check mkdir command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

Create a testd directory:

```bash
mkdir testd
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/mkdir_testd_ll.png" title="List the created directory" alt="img" %}}

Create a multilevel directory:

```bash
mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e/f/g
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/mkdir_multilevel_tree.png" title="List the created directories as tree-like format" alt="img" %}}

# Remove Directory

We can use the *rmdir* command to delete directories, but it can only be used to remove empty directories:

```bash
man rmdir
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_rmdir.png" title="Check the rmdir command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

We can use the *rmdir* command to delete the testd directory we just created:

```bash
rmdir testd
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/rmdir_ll.png" title="The testd directory has gone" alt="img" %}}

# List Tree-like Directory Contents

Because CentOS 7 doesn't have this install this tool by default, so we need to get it manually:

```bash
yum install tree -y
```

We can use the *tree* command to display the structure of the directory in a tree-like format.

```bash
man tree
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_tree.png" title="Check tree command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

Let's try this command on the multilevel directory we created above:

```bash
tree a
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/tree.png" title="List the directory contents recursively in a tree-like format" alt="img" %}}

# Change Working Directory

We can use the *cd* command to switch the working directory to another directory:

```bash
help cd
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/help_cd.png" title="Check cd command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

With this command, we can switch the current working directory to directory *a* we just created:

```bash
cd a
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/cd_ll.png" title="Change our working directory to directory a and list the contents" alt="img" %}}

We can also change our working directory to a multilevel directory at once:

```bash
cd b/c/d/e/f
pwd
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/cd_multilevel_pwd_ll.png" title="Change our working directory to multilevel directory, prints the working directory path, and list the contents" alt="img" %}}

# Create Empty File

We can use the *touch* command to create empty files:

```bash
man touch
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_touch.png" title="Check touch command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

Let's create an empty file:

```bash
touch a
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/touch_ll.png" title="This creates an empty file" alt="img" %}}

We can create multiple empty files at once:

```bash
touch b c d
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/touch_multiple_ll.png" title="This creates multiple empty files at once" alt="img" %}}

# Move File or Directory

We can use the *mv* command to move files or directories to other directories:

```bash
man mv
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_mv.png" title="Check mv command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

With this command, we can move the file a to the directory g:

```bash
mv a g
ll g
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/mv_move.png" title="Move file a to directory g" alt="img" %}}

We can also use this command to change the name of a file or directory:

```bash
mv b two
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/mv_rename.png" title="Rename file b to two" alt="img" %}}

# Copy File or Directory

We can copy files or directories using the *cp* command:

```bash
man cp
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_cp.png" title="Check cp command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

We can use this command to back up the file c as c_bak:

```bash
cp c c_bak
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/cp_ll.png" title="This command backs up the file c as c_bak" alt="img" %}}

We can also copy the file d intactly to the directory g:

```bash
cp d g
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/cp_directory_ll.png" title="This command the file d in directory g" alt="img" %}}

# System Status of File and Directory

You can use the *stat* command to view system status information for files or directories:

```bash
man stat
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_stat.png" title="Check stat command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

Let's take a look at the system status of the file d and the directory g, respectively:

```bash
stat d
ll
stat g
ll
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/stat_file_directory.png" title="Check the system status for file d and directory g" alt="img" %}}

# Remove File or Directory

We can use the *rm* command to delete files or directories:

```bash
man rm
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/man_rm.png" title="Check rm command's definition and usage" alt="img" %}}

We can use the rm command to delete the file c:

```bash
rm c
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/ll_rm_file_ll.png" title="File c has been removed with my confirmation, or I can just type y instead of yes" alt="img" %}}

We can also use this command to delete the directory g:

```bash
rm -r g    # -r argument means to recursively remove the files and directories under directory g
```

{{% figure src="../images/8/tree_rm_directory_tree.png" title="All file under the directory g included itself have been removed with my confirmation" alt="img" %}}

If this directory has a lot of files and we don't want ignore the confirmation for every file or directory, then we have to add the -f parameter, which means that the deletion is enforced and no manual approval is required.
