# File Types

When you use the "ll" command to list all files in a directory, the first letter of each line is the type of file. Linux has 7 file types that can be classified into these 3 categories:

- Regular file types
- Directory file types
- Special file types

{{% admonition tip "File Types" %}}
Let's look at each of the 7 file types.

{{% admonition question "d (Directory file types category)" %}}
Each line of information printed by command "ll" begins with letter d is a directory file type.

{{% admonition question "- (Regular file types category)" %}}
Each line of information printed by command "ll" begins with symbol - is a regular file type.

{{% admonition question "l (Special file types category)" %}}

# File Naming Conventions

- No more than 255 characters in length
- The filename can't contain slashes (/)
- Filenames are case-sensitive

# File Paths

- Relative path: Starts from current directory, such as ./..
- Absolute path: Starts from root directory, such as /..
