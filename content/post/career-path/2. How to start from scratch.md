# My Experience

I started working in the industry in early 2014 until 2019, five years ago, but I stumbled upon a pattern. A trendy technology that is fast in popularity, and which will be eliminated very quickly. So I've come to the conclusion that you don't want to catch up with fashion technology for no reason, but before you catch up, do you think it's going to be out of date? If so, how long will it be out of time? Five years? One year? Or six months? Here are two examples of a project that we did with bootstrap 3 several years ago. Now that Bootstrap 4 has came out, it doesn't change much, so it's not particularly hard to upgrade. Instead, one of the projects we did after that was based on Angularjs 1, then Angularjs 2, and then Angularjs 8. Oh my goodness.

# Entry start point recommendation

Rather than focusing too much on business requirements, more attention should be paid to the consolidation of basic knowledge.

- Mathematics knowledge in senior middle school and above
- Data structure and algorithm
- Knowledge of infrastructure (hardware: cpu, memory, collaboration time of storage devices such as hard drives when accessing data structures through algorithms, etc.)
- Linux operation principle
- Network related knowledge
- Understand runtime efficiency of languages such as c java php go python. 
- Must learn a web universal server: nginx (high concurrency, load balance, keepalive,web firewall) 

# A culture of programmers that you need to know

- DevOps (Site Reliable Engineer)

# Trends that has become a reality

- Micro Services
- Service Mesh
- Artificial Intelligence for Development and Operation
