# A unit of measurement that is often misleading

I often see people confuse the time and space units of Nginx, which is especially prevalent among beginners. One measure unit that most often misleads them is an m letter, which can be expressed either as megabytes or as minutes.

## Space Measurement Units

### Bytes

```nginx
1024    # A unit without a suffix letter stands for bytes.
```

### Kilobytes

```nginx
8k    # A unit with a suffix letter 'k' or 'K' stands for kilobytes.
```

### Megabytes

```nginx
1m    # A unit with a suffix letter 'm' or 'M' stands for megabytes.
```

### Unit conversion common sense review

This is for absolute non technical beginners:

- 8 bits = 1 byte
- 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte
- 1024 kilobytes = 1 megabyte
- 1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte

## Time Measurement Units

### Milliseconds

```nginx
1000ms    # A unit with two suffix letters 'ms' stands for milliseconds.
```

### Seconds

```nginx
60s    # A unit with a suffix letter 's' stands for seconds.
```

### Minutes

```nginx
60m    # A unit with a suffix letter 'm' stands for minutes.
```

### Hours

```nginx
24h    # A unit with a suffix letter 'h' stands for hours.
```

### Days

```nginx
30d    # A unit with a suffix letter 'd' stands for days.
```

### Weeks

```nginx
4w    # A unit with a suffix letter 'w' stands for weeks.
```

### Months

```nginx
12M    # A unit with a suffix letter 'M' stands for months, and 1M stands for 30 days.
```

### Years

```nginx
1y    # A unit with a suffix letter 'y' stands for months, and 1y stands for 365 days.
```
