CentOS does not install autocompletion support for all tools by default, so we need to install it manually.

# Check If We Have Bash Completion Installed

We can use the following command to verify:

```bash
yum list installed | grep completion
```

We won't see any output if it hasn't been installed, so we need to install this package:

# Install

```bash
yum install bash-completion -y
```

Although it is installed, it has not yet been loaded into the running bash, so we need to use the source command to load them into the bash:

# Reload

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
```

{{% figure src="../images/11/source_etc_profile_d_bash_completion_sh.png" title="currently there is only one tool completely support autocompletion" alt="img" %}}

# Experiment

Now we can try typing yum and then pressing the tab key twice:

```bash
yum    # There is no space behind yum command
```

{{% figure src="../images/11/yum_tab.png" title="after typing yum, we press tab key twice" alt="img" %}}

We can see a list of auto-complete recommendations for this command.

We can also try automatic completion of yum parameters:

```bash
yum     # There is a space behind yum command
```

{{% figure src="../images/11/yum_space_tab.png" title="after adding a space behind yum, we press tab key twice" alt="img" %}}

All right, that's all the auto-complete information. See reference for more information.
