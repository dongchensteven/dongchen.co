With RAID technology, we can combine multiple disks in some way to improve performance or reliability.

# Frequently Used Levels

* RAID0
* RAID1
* RAID5
* RAID10
* RAID50
* JBOD

# RAID 0

Here are some common features of RAID 0:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | N * min(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | None |
| Minimum disk numbers | 2 or more disks |

* N = Number of disks.
* min() = The minimal space disk between disks.
* S{1|2|N} = Disks.

# RAID 1

Here are some common features of RAID 1:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read performance | Upgraded |
| Write performance | Degraded |
| Available spaces | 1 * min(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | N - 1 disk. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 2 or more disks |

# RAID 2 (OBSOLETE)

RAID 2 is deprecated.

# RAID 3 (OBSOLETE)

RAID 3 is replaced by RAID 5.

{{% figure src="../images/62/RAID3.png" title="Image created by Cburnett. CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1509118" alt="img" %}}

# RAID 4

Multiple diskettes of exclusive or calculated values are stored on a checkout disk, any of which can be used to calculate the damaged disk's data by using another disk when it is damaged, but if the checksum disk is also broken, then the data isn't able to be recovered. Therefore, the reliability of this combination is very low.

Here are some common features of RAID 4:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read performance | Upgraded |
| Write performance | Degraded |
| Available spaces | (N - 1) * min(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | One disk. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 3 or more disks |

# RAID 5

Here are some common features of RAID 5:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | (N - 1) * min(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | One disk. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 3 or more disks |

# RAID 6

Here are some common features of RAID 6:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | (N - 2) * min(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | Two disks. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 4 or more disks |

# Nested RAID

## RAID 10

Here are some common features of RAID 10:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | N * min(S1, S2, ...) / 2 |
| Fault tolerance | One faulty disk at most in every image. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 4 or more disks |

## RAID 50

Here are some common features of RAID 50:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | N * min(S1, S2, ...) / 3 |
| Fault tolerance | One faulty disk at most in every image. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 6 or more disks |

## RAID 60

Here are some common features of RAID 60:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Upgraded |
| Available spaces | N * min(S1, S2, ...) / 4 |
| Fault tolerance | One faulty disk at most in every image. |
| Minimum disk numbers | 8 or more disks |

# Non-RAID drive architectures

## JBOD

One of the Non-RAID drive architectures. The space of multiple disks is combined into a large continuous space.

Here are some common features of JBOD:

| Feature | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| Read write performance | Unknown |
| Available spaces | sum(S1, S2, ...) |
| Fault tolerance | None |
| Minimum disk numbers | 2 or more disks |

* sum() = The summation of all disk spaces.

# Manage Linux Software RAID

The used partitions' systems should be set to Linux raid autodetect.

Linux supports LINEAR md devices:

* RAID0 (striping)
* RAID1 (mirroring)
* RAID4
* RAID5
* RAID6
* RAID10
* MULTIPATH
* FAULTY
* CONTAINER.

Here are some mode specific options for mdadm command:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -A | Assemble a pre-existing array. |
| -C | Create a new array, -n #: Specify the number of active devices in the array. -l #: Set RAID level.  When used with --create, options are: linear, raid0, 0, stripe, raid1, 1, mirror, raid4, 4, raid5, 5, raid6, 6, raid10, 10, multipath, mp, faulty, container. |
| -F | Select monitor mode. |

Here are some manage mode options for mdadm command:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -a | Hot-add listed devices. |
| -r | Remove listed devices. |
| -f | Mark listed devices as faulty. |

Here are some misc mode options for mdadm command:

| Option | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------------|
| -D | Print details of one or more md devices. |
| -S | Deactivate aray, releasing all resources. |

```bash
mdadm [MODE] <raiddevice> [OPTION] <component-devices>
```

## View md status

```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```
