Type is a command to view command types. We can look at what types this command can see with the help of the help command:

{{% figure src="../images/7/help_type.png" title="there are five types" alt="img" %}}

# Alias

Alias is a shortcut to commands, such as *ll* is a simplified version of *ls -l*:

# Keyword

Shell has some reserved keywords, *while* is one of them:

# Function

We can use the *declare -F* command to get the defined functions.

{{% figure src="../images/7/declare_f.png" title="it is a shell reversed keyword" alt="img" %}}

From the results of the command execution above, we know that *quote* is a function:

{{% figure src="../images/7/type_quote.png" title="it is a shell reversed keyword" alt="img" %}}

We can also use *declare*'s synonym to get the function, which is typeset:

{{% figure src="../images/7/help_typeset.png" title="these are system defined functions" alt="img" %}}

# Builtin

The *declare* command we use is built into Bash:

{{% figure src="../images/7/type_declare.png" title="it is a bash shell builtin command" alt="img" %}}

[More...](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Builtin-Index.html#Builtin-Index)

# File

Some of the commonly used file type commands are *mkdir*, *cp*, *mv*, *touch*, *rm*:

{{% figure src="../images/7/type_mkdir_cp_mv_touch_rm.png" title="commonly used file type commands" alt="img" %}}

We can append the -t parameter behind the type command to get the commands types:

{{% figure src="../images/7/type_t_mkdir_cp_mv_touch_rm.png" title="list types by appending the -t parameter" alt="img" %}}
