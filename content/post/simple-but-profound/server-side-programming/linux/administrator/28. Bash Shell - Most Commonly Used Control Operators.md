We can use the control operators provided by linux to facilitate the use of commands and the processing of the results of command execution.

<!--more-->

Let's prepare some test data for these two control operators:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'File One First Line' 'File One Second Line' > file1
printf '%s\n' 'File Two First Line' 'File Two Second Line' > file2
cat file1
cat file2
```

# Ampersand Ampersand Operator

We can use two ampersand symbol to concatenate a series of commands and execute them sequentially:

```bash
&&
```

## Usage of &&

We can print the contents of the two files in order:

```bash
cat file1 && cat file2
```

{{% figure src="../images/28/cat_file_two_ampersands_cat_file.png" title="Print the contents of each file sequentially" alt="img" %}}

## When a Command in Ampersands Fails

When a command fails, none of its subsequent commands will be executed.

Let's try printing a file that doesn't exist:

```bash
cat file11 && cat file2
```

{{% figure src="../images/28/cat_file_fails_two_ampersands_cat_file.png" title="Prints an error message, because the first file does not exist" alt="img" %}}

# Pipe Pipe Operator

Another control works differently, executing the next command only if the previous command fails:

```bash
||
```

## Usage of ||

We can print the contents of one of the files, and when the previous file does not exist, then the contents of the following file is printed:

```bash
cat file1 || cat file2
```

{{% figure src="../images/28/cat_file_two_pipes_cat_file.png" title="Print the first file's content only" alt="img" %}}

## When a Command in Pipes Fails

When a command fails, the next command will be executed.

Let's try printing a file that doesn't exist:

```bash
cat file11 || cat file2
```

{{% figure src="../images/28/cat_file_fails_two_pipes_cat_file.png" title="Prints an error from the first command and followed by the contents of the second file" alt="img" %}}

## Ignore the Error Message

We can redirect the error message to null:

```bash
cat file11 2> /dev/null || cat file2
```
