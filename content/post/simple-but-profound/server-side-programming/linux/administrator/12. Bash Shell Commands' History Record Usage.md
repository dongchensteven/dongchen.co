With the command reuse feature of the bash shell, it is easy to use a previous command again or to see what commands we have recently used.

# History File Location

```bash
echo $HISTFILE
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/echo_HISTFILE.png" title="the file that records the used commands" alt="img" %}}

# History Size

```bash
echo $HISTSIZE
echo $HISTFILESIZE
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/echo_HISTSIZE_echo_HISTFILESIZE.png" title="these two commands show the amount of the lines of commands they can keep" alt="img" %}}

# History List

```bash
history
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/history.png" title="shows all recently used commands" alt="img" %}}

# Run Previous Command

```bash
!!    # Ctrl+P can achieve similar results
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/ls_!!.png" title="!! reexecutes the ls command" alt="img" %}}

# Run Recorded Command

```bash
!1    # runs the first recorded command
!-1    # runs the last recorded command
!N    # runs the command on N line
```

# Delete Executed Command

```bash
pwd    # this will be the previous command
ls; history -d $(history 1)    # $(history 1) retrieves the last command's line number
!!    # runs the previous command
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/pwd_ls_history_d_!!.png" title="the previous command is pwd not ls" alt="img" %}}

# Run Commands Without Saving

```bash
echo $HISTFILE
unset HISTFILE
echo $HISTFILE
```

{{% figure src="../images/12/echo_HISTFILE_unset_HISTFILE_echo_HISTFILE.png" title="!! reexecutes the ls command" alt="img" %}}

# Empty History Records

```bash
history -c    # takes effect after the user logged out
history -w    # saves the changes to the .bash_history file, so the action takes effect immediately
```
