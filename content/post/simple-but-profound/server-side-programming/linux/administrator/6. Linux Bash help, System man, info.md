# Bash Help Command

Let's take a look at what bash is, and you can see it through *whatis bash*, *apropos bash* or *man -k bash* commands:

{{% figure src="../images/6/apropos_bash.png" title="bash is GNU's Bourne-Again SHell" alt="img" %}}

The builtins is actually a soft link to bash-builtins:

{{% figure src="../images/6/bash_builtins.png" title="builtins is a soft link to bash-builtins" alt="img" %}}

So we can use *man builtins*, *info builtins*, *man bash-builtins* or *info bash-builtins* commands to view bash's built-in commands:

{{% figure src="../images/6/man_builtins.png" title="after running man builtins command" alt="img" %}}

*help* is bash's built-in documentation command to see how built-in functions are used, for example *help cd* command:

{{% figure src="../images/6/help_cd.png" title="after running help cd command" alt="img" %}}

We can use the help command to see how it works:

{{% figure src="../images/6/help_help.png" title="help help command result" alt="img" %}}

# Info and Man Commands

The two commands, *man* and *info*, are not too different. They are both used to see how system commands are used and complement the *help* command.

We can view the purpose of the *man* command by executing the *man man* command or the *info man* command:

{{% figure src="../images/6/man_man.png" title="man man and info man commands result" alt="img" %}}

We can view the purpose of the *info* command by executing the *man info* command or the *info info* command:

{{% figure src="../images/6/man_info.png" title="man info and info info commands result" alt="img" %}}

When you use *info* or *man* to view the manual of bash built-in command *cd*, you don't see it:

{{% figure src="../images/6/info_man_cd.png" title="after running info cd and man cd commands" alt="img" %}}

We can take a look at which commands the info command provides a manual:

{{% figure src="../images/6/info.png" title="after running info command" alt="img" %}}

# Summary

At the end, we can find out where *info* and *man* commands are and what they are, but we can't find where *help* command is and what it is:

{{% figure src="../images/6/what_where_are_help_info_man.png" title="don't see any info about help, but it's a bash built-in command" alt="img" %}}
